However, as well as facilitating new ways for combining work and personal life, these new technologies can also blur the boundary between the two domains. In recent years tablets have become popular, first as leisure devices, and lately as business tools helping people to stay connected with work anywhere, anytime. Through an online questionnaire supported by a qualitative study, we investigated why, how, and where office workers use tablets and what impact those devices may have on work-life balance. The results show that, while useful for both home and work tasks, tablets have the potential to blur the boundary between work and personal life by encouraging and enabling people to complete work tasks during home time and vice versa. This could have negative impacts on work-life balance.","","2019-04-20 08:36:01","2019-04-20 08:36:02","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>While enabling people to<br />better combine work and non-work responsibilities,<br />mobile technologies also have the potential to produce<br />a more demanding workplace that threatens workers’<br />work-life balance (WLB).

Our findings demonstrate that mobile phones were primarily used to manage other personal activities and concerns unrelated to the local work. They were used only intermittently to support local practice when that practice itself moved away from fixed resources. The fact that people were consistently using their mobile phones at work to attend to other concerns is an important feature of mobile technology use. This personal aspect of use in the work context has been largely overlooked within the Mobile HCI literature. In particular, our findings reveal the ways in which freelancers manage the blurring of contexts that is facilitated by mobile phones. We consider implications of these findings for the ways in which we currently talk and think about mobile technology use within Mobile HCI.","","2019-04-19 11:14:03","2019-04-19 11:14:03","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BSCJCQPZ\Sadler и Robertson - Balancing Work, Life and Other Concerns A Study o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the evidence for moderately LWH (41&ndash;60 h a week) is contradictory. Although poor job quality has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of this relationship, there are almost no studies about LWH and job quality. The objectives of this study were to analyze the association between moderately LWH and job quality in the EU27, as well as to examine differences by welfare regimes and gender. This is a cross-sectional study based on data from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey. A subsample of employees from the EU27 aged 16&ndash;64 years who worked 30&ndash;60 h a week was selected (12,574 men and 8787 women). Overall, moderately LWH were not consistently associated with poor job quality except among women from Eastern European countries. Therefore, in the EU27 poor job quality does not seem to explain the relationship between moderately LWH and poor health status. The findings among women from Eastern European countries may be related to their weakened position in the labor market and to their work-family conflict resulting from a process of re-familisation that constrains their choices for a good job.","2018-11","2019-04-19 08:09:27","2019-04-19 08:09:27","2019-04-19 08:09:27","2592","","11","15","","","Long Working Hours and Job Quality in Europe","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MEMY3R78\Artazcoz и др. - 2018 - Long Working Hours and Job Quality in Europe Gend.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KQS6R5XC\ijerph-15-02592.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NJ69XJAV\2592.html","","","gender; socioeconomic factors; working conditions; working time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied a quasi-experimental design within a large Dutch financial company (N = 2,912). We studied an intervention group (n = 2,391) and made comparisons with a reference group (n = 521). There were three study waves: (i) one/two months before, and (ii) 4 months and (iii) 10 months after implementation of NWW. Repeated measures analyses of covariance (involving 361 participants from the intervention group and 80 participants from the reference group) showed a large and significant shift from hours worked at the office to hours worked at home after implementation of NWW. Accordingly, commuting time was reduced. Employees remained working on week days and during day time. Psychosocial work-characteristics, work–nonwork balance, stress, fatigue, and job-related outcomes remained favourable and largely unaffected, but the health score in the intervention group decreased (medium effect). These findings suggest that the implementation of NWW does not necessarily lead to changes in psychosocial work characteristics, well-being or job-related outcomes.","2016-07-02","2019-04-19 08:01:24","2019-04-19 08:01:24","2019-04-19 08:01:24","604-618","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","PMID: 27223247","<p>New ways of working (NWW) is a type of work organization that is characterized by temporal and<br />spatial flexibility, often combined with extensive use of information and communication technologies<br />(ICT) and performance-based management.</p> <p>NWW is a type of work organization that is<br />characterized by a combination of temporal and<br />spatial flexibility (e.g. Baane, et al., 2011; Blok et al.,<br />2011).</p> <p>We define NWW as ‘Time and<br />place-independent work, often combined with<br />extensive use of ICT and performance based<br />management’.</p> <p>According to the ‘sunny perspective on NWW’,<br />increased autonomy over work could improve<br />employees’ motivation (e.g. Hackman &amp; Oldham,<br />1976; Pritchard &amp; Payne, 2003) and thereby increase<br />organizational performance.

As one such technique, logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable’s unique contribution. Using components of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination of variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, with commonly recommended minimum “rules of thumb” ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three general types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, and stepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods, one should formally quantify the model’s internal validity (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting logistic regression model’s overall fit to the sample data is assessed using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized by a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).","2011","2019-04-18 15:49:28","2019-04-18 15:49:28","2019-04-18 15:49:28","1099-1104","","10","18","","","Logistic Regression","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\J5YDCDMQ\Stoltzfus - 2011 - Logistic Regression A Brief Primer.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HW2Q3TN6\j.1553-2712.2011.01185.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It evolves toward a more fluid, active and horizontal form of socialisation (Bauman, 2000; Castells, 2009; Sheller & Urry, 2006; Urry, 2000; Wittel, 2001). As much as a change in the social, it is also a change in the conception sociology gives to the sociality and society as large. There is a shift in social theory with recent raises of post-demographic perspective, and postmodernism (Latour, 2005, 2011, 2013; Ruppert, Law, & Savage, 2013).Along these, post changes, another revolution takes place, in the use of new technology and mainly the Web. These new uses are associated with an explosion of the quantity of digital traces, often labelled as Big Data.This Big Data paradigm brings radical changes in research that are perfectly suitable for computational researchers and other data scientists, and they are taking full advantage of it (Hey, Tansley, & Tolle, 2009). This new landscape, in society and in research, puts pressure on sociology, and other social sciences fields, to find adequate answers to these societal, theoretical and methodological challenges. The best proxy of these challenges and the tensions between scientific fields and the new form of social interactions are the Social Network Sites (SNSs). They represent the extreme case of horizontal and fluid interactions while producing an incredible amount of accessible digital traces.These digital traces are the essential bricks for all the research using SNSs. But despite this importance, few researches actually investigate and explain how these digital traces are produced and what is the impact of their context of access, collection and aggregation. This thesis focuses on these digital traces and the gap left in the literature. This empty space is however conceived as a central point of tension between sociological positions on how to define new social interactions, and methodological principles imposed by the logic of Big Data.The work is articulated around one specific social network, Twitter. The reason for this choice lays in its openness, the easy use of its APIs, and, in consequence, by the fact it is the most extensively studied SNS for now.I begin the work on the definition of the new form of sociality using the network concept as the key concept around which several notions, such as social, cultural and technological can be articulated. I conclude that none of these evolutions are independent and need to be seen as co-integrated. In consequence, the change in the social interaction needs to be seen as much as a factual change, than a change in our way to interpret it. From this conception of the network and the importance in our understanding of social interactions, I retrace the evolution of the notion of Big Data, specifically with the example of Tesco and their ClubCard. This is the first step to locate the technological changes into a more comprehensive methodological framework. This framework, the transactional perspective, is decomposed to understand the consequence of such position applied on SNSs and specifically on Twitter. This is the first explanation of why the research almost entirely focuses on the Tweets and what are the consequences on our understanding of the interaction on the social web service. Then I use this first iteration of the definition of a digital trace to build a new definition of what a Social Network Site is and centre this definition around the concept of activity and context.I operationalise these concepts on Twitter to develop a new method to capture social interaction and digital traces that are often put aside due to the difficulty of their access. This method takes into account the limits imposed by the Twitter APIs and describes the consequences they have on the generation of a dataset.The method is based on a constant screening of sampled profiles over time. This method allows people/us/you to reconstruct the missing information in the profile (the trace of the changes in the friends’ and followers’ lists). This information creates the measure of context (the user’s network) and activity (tweeting and adding or removing links) defined earlier.The obtained dataset provides an opportunity to see the importance of the aggregation process and the flexibility offered by the digital traces. Then following this, I developed three analyses with different levels of aggregation for different purposes. The first analysis was to test the hypothesis of the influence on users’ context activity on their own activity over time. The second analysis, did not use the time as a measure of aggregation but tested the same hypothesis on an individual level. And finally, the information about the activity itself is analysed in order to see to which extent the digital traces obtainable contain the sufficient information about the change in activity itself.","2016-06-01","2019-04-08 09:15:30","2019-04-08 09:15:30","","","","","","","","Digital traces, sociology and twitter","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323185031_Digital_traces_sociology_and_twitter_between_false_promises_and_real_potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet candidates who compile experiences across disparate areas can either be appreciated as renaissance individuals or penalized as dilettantes. Extant literature has focused on the comparison between single versus multiple category members and on skill assessment, hindering its applicability. To discriminate between more versus less successful category spanners, I suggest that the order of accumulated experiences matters, because it serves as an indicator of commitment. I propose the concept of erraticism and predict that employers will prefer candidates who demonstrate some erraticism, by moving incrementally between similar jobs, over candidates who do not move and also over those with highly erratic job histories. Furthermore, I suggest this relationship holds for more complex jobs, less experienced freelancers, and is attenuated through working together. These issues are particularly salient given the rise of external labor markets where careers are increasingly marked by moves across traditional boundaries. I test and find support for these hypotheses with data from an online crowd-sourced labor market for freelancing services, Elance.com.

The exponential growth of this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this importance, limited eﬀort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may aﬀect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasiexperimental technique, we ﬁnd evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-speciﬁc traits that could inﬂuence hiring outcomes. We ﬁnd that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in femininetyped occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also ﬁnd that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our ﬁndings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers. Managerial and practical implications are discussed.","2018-07","2019-04-03 06:27:27","2019-04-03 06:30:43","2019-04-03 06:27:27","2973-2994","","7","64","","","Hiring Preferences in Online Labor Markets","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\555428AR\Chan и Wang - 2018 - Hiring Preferences in Online Labor Markets Eviden.pdf","","рабочие часы","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In just the past several years, we have witnessed the birth and rapid spread of social media, mobile phones, and numerous other digital marvels. In addition to changing how we live, these tools enable us to collect and process data about human behavior on a scale never before imaginable, offering entirely new approaches to core questions about social behavior. Bit by Bit is the key to unlocking these powerful methods-a landmark book that will fundamentally change how the next generation of social scientists and data scientists explores the world around us. Bit by Bit is the essential guide to mastering the key principles of doing social research in this fast-evolving digital age. In this comprehensive yet accessible book, Matthew Salganik explains how the digital revolution is transforming how social scientists observe behavior, ask questions, run experiments, and engage in mass collaborations. He provides a wealth of real-world examples throughout, and also lays out a principles-based approach to handling ethical challenges in the era of social media. Bit by Bit is an invaluable resource for social scientists who want to harness the research potential of big data and a must-read for data scientists interested in applying the lessons of social science to tomorrow's technologies","2018","2019-02-23 09:47:50","2019-02-23 09:47:50","","","423","","","","","Bit by bit","","","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","H62 .S3189 2018","OCLC: on1012406622","<p>In the analog age, collecting data about behavior—who does what, and<br />when—was expensive and therefore relatively rare.

In almost every case, people held more extreme positions after they spoke with like-minded others.</p> <p>But is social media really at fault here? In a study published earlier this year in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, researchers at Stanford University examined political polarization in the US and found that it was increasing far faster among the demographic groups least likely to use social media and the internet. “The 65-year-olds are polarizing more quickly than the younger age group, which is the opposite of what you’d expect if social media and the internet were the driver,” says Levi Boxell, the lead author of the study.</p> <p>for most Trump supporters, talk radio, local news, and Fox—a pre-internet filter bubble—were far more important sources than tweets or fake news on Facebook.</p> <p>“The internet is absolutely not the causal factor here,” says Ethan Zuckerman, who directs MIT’s Center for Civic Media. “But I think we’re experiencing a phenomenon that began with Fox News and now is sort of extending into the social-media space.”</p> <p>After the 2016 election, Zuckerman and some collaborators designed a tool called Gobo that lets people adjust their own bubbles via sliders that control content filters. For instance, the “politics” slider ranges from “my perspective” to “lots of perspectives.” Choosing the latter end exposes people to media outlets they probably wouldn’t normally see.</p> <p>Another tool, Social Mirror, was developed by members of Deb Roy’s lab. Earlier this year they reported on the results of an experiment conducted with the tool, which uses data visualization to give Twitter users a bird’s-eye view of how their network of followers and friends fits into the overall universe of Twitter. Most of those recruited to use the tool were politically active Twitter users, and many were surprised to learn just how cocooned inside far-right or far-left bubbles they were.</p> <p>The impact of the experiment was short-lived, however. Though a week after it ended some participants were following a more diverse set of Twitter accounts than before, two to three weeks later most had gone back to homogeneity. And in another twist, people who ended up following more contrarian accounts—suggested by the researchers to help them diversify their Twitter feeds—subsequently reported that they’d be even <em>less</em> inclined to talk to people with opposing political views.</p> <p>The early United States, he noted in an essay for the <em>Atlantic</em>, featured a highly partisan press tailored to very specific audiences. But publishers and editors for the most part abided by a strong cultural norm, republishing a wide range of stories from different parts of the nation and reflecting different political leanings. Public broadcasters in many democracies have also focused on providing a wide range of perspectives. It’s not realistic, Zuckerman argues, to expect the same from outlets like Facebook: their business model drives them to pander to our natural human desire to congregate with others like ourselves.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BBBBL3UZ\technologists-are-trying-to-fix-the-filter-bubble-problem-that-tech-helped-create.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms.

Yet this conception has ignored fundamental<br />changes in the way that the public uses the internet, specifically with respect to social<br />media and news consumption. We argue that the socialization of internet news fundamentally<br />alters the context in which news reading occurs, providing a venue that promotes<br />exposure to news from politically heterogeneous individuals, and which serves to emphasize<br />social value rather than partisan affiliation.</p> <p>Social media shape the modern media landscape in two ways. First, because these websites<br />and mobile applications display content from different news providers in a single location,<br />users no longer need to select a news source; instead they select the story itself. This represents<br />a fundamental break from past modes of news consumption wherein people<br />habituated themselves to a trusted source—instead social media users can select news<br />from a wide range of sources deemed by friends or fellow internet users to be interesting<br />or important. This suggests that habitual de facto selective exposure (Sears &amp; Freeman,<br />1967) will be substantially less common in the context of social media.</p> <p>de facto limits to the political diversity of one’s social context are much less severe<br />online. Most aggregation services do not consider political slant when collecting content,<br />while social networking websites like Facebook encourage users to maintain a vast array<br />of online relationships comprising of both strong and weak ties (Hampton, Goulet, Her, &amp;<br />Rainie, 2009), often including coworkers, with whom the potential for cross-cutting discourse<br />that introduces counterattitudinal information is substantially higher (Mutz &amp;<br />Mondak, 2006).</p> <p>if social<br />endorsements affect selection to a greater extent than source labels, then there is some<br />hope for cross-cutting exposure in the context of social media.

The key concern motivating the present paper is that, due to the low salience and “difficult” nature of science for members of the general public, it may not be sensible to require respondents to choose from amongst a small and predefined set of evaluative response categories. Here, we pursue a different methodological approach: the analysis of textual responses to “open-ended” questions, in which respondents are asked to state, in their own words, what they understand by the term “DNA.” To this textual data we apply the statistical clustering procedures encoded in the Alceste software package to detect and classify underlying discourse and narrative structures.

Under the assumption that social networks are homophilic, I develop a Bayesian Spatial Following model that considers ideology as a latent variable, whose value can be inferred by examining which politics actors each user is following. This method allows us to estimate ideology for more actors than any existing alternative, at any point in time and across many polities. I apply this method to estimate ideal points for a large sample of both elite and mass public Twitter users in the United States and five European countries. The estimated positions of legislators and political parties replicate conventional measures of ideology. The method is also able to successfully classify individuals who state their political preferences publicly and a sample of users matched with their party registration records. To illustrate the potential contribution of these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior during the 2012 US presidential election campaign is clustered along ideological lines.","2015","2019-02-20 06:56:17","2019-02-20 06:56:17","2019-02-20 06:56:17","76-91","","1","23","","","Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge Core","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IU5K2SAS\Barberá - 2015 - Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together Bayesian.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HG4JJ42S\91E37205F69AEA32EF27F12563DC2A0A.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Russian blogging is dominated by a handful of these ""SNS hybrids."" • While the larger Russian blogosphere is highly divided according to platform, there is a central Discussion Core that contains the majority of political and public affairs discourse. This core is comprised mainly, though not exclusively, of blogs on the LiveJournal platform. • The Discussion Core features four major groupings: — Politics and Public Affairs (including news-focused discussion, business and finance, social activists, and political movements) — Culture (including literature, cinema, high culture, and popular culture) — Regional (bloggers in Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia, Israel, etc.) — Instrumental (paid blogging and blogging for external incentives) • Political/public affairs bloggers cover a broad spectrum of attitudes and agendas and include many who discuss politics from an independent standpoint, as well as those affiliated with offline political and social movements, including strong ‘Democratic Opposition’ and 'Nationalist' clusters. • The Russian political blogosphere supports more cross-linking debate than others we have studied (including those of the U.S. and Iran), and appears less subject to the formation of self-referential 'echo chambers.' • Pro-government bloggers are not especially prominent and do not constitute their own cluster, but are mostly located in a part of the network featuring general discussion of Russian public affairs. However, there is a concentration of bloggers affiliated with pro-government youth groups among the Instrumental bloggers. • We find evidence of political and social mobilization, particularly in those clusters affiliated with offline political and social movements. • The online 'news diet' of Russian bloggers is more independent, international, and oppositional than that of Russian Internet users overall, and far more so than that of non-Internet users, who are more reliant upon state-controlled federal TV channels. • Popular political YouTube videos focus on corruption and abuse of power by elites, the government, and the police.","2010-10-19","2019-02-16 08:41:35","2019-02-16 08:41:35","2019-02-16 08:41:35","","","","","","","Public Discourse in the Russian Blogosphere","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","<p>The Russian political blogosphere supports more cross-linking debate than others we have<br />studied (including those of the U.S. and Iran), and appears less subject to the formation of<br />self-referential ‘echo chambers.’</p> <p>Pro-government bloggers are not especially prominent and do not constitute their own cluster,<br />but are mostly located in a part of the network featuring general discussion of Russian public<br />affairs.

These differences are evident on multiple lavers: a) the research design (digital trace data or tracking, large scale surveys or experiments), b) the sample size of the sample and how representative it is of the population (e.g., Digital news survey uses a large representative sample, whereas the experiments (e.g., Dylko et al) are carried out with university students, c) the conceptualization and operationalization of diversity (viewpoint diversity, topic diversity, or network diversity) and, most importantly, whether or not they find evidence for detrimental effects of algorithmic news recommendation. On a general level, we can conclude that while the larger scale studies provide little evidence of negative effects of algorithms on the diversity of the content (e.g. Bashky et al 2015.) or users attitudes and behavior (e.g. Reuters Digital news study), smaller more experimental studies do find significant effects.</p> <p>However, there is evidence that algorithmic filtering contributes to a fundamental transformation of news audiences</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7Q7USBH3\Beyond_the_filter_bubble__concepts_myths_evidence_and_issues_for_future_debates.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FBFXAKVE\search.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies that examine digital news use draw from observed audience behavior. Furthermore, little is known about whether or not different digital platforms affect how audiences actually attend to news. This article addresses these gaps. Using online audience data, we find that over the past year, the mobile news audience has indeed surpassed the desktop news audience in size, and that a subset of this audience devotes an enormous amount of time to news apps, especially compared with time spent on desktop devices. In light of our findings, we argue the mobile news audience should be seen not as one homogenous mass, but as two distinct groups—mobile news browsers and mobile app users.

Quite uncommon.</p> <p>They use the number of news sources as a dependent variable.</p> <p>Rather than asking people to provide a figure, the measure was produced by asking respondents to select from a list of around 30 of the most popular online news sources in each country.</p> <p>Only 6.2 percent of respondent used news aggregators for news</p> <p>Incidential exposure on Youtube and Twitter is higher compared to Facebook. On Youtube this is probably due to users are being exposed to news on the frontpage: ""One possibility is that people are exposed to news on the homepage, if they browse lists of the most popular videos, or are automatically recommended a news video after watching a non-news video on a similar topic.""</p> <p>Cross-countries differencies are small in effect</p> <p>Contrary to the concern that the move to a high-choice environment will lead to increased polarization between news lovers who seek out news and those less interested who do not (Bennett and Iyengar, 2008; Prior, 2005), and fear that social media limit the diversity of news people are exposed to (Pariser, 2011), we find that social media use is in fact significantly related with increased news use, even amongst those who come across news on social media while doing other things.</p> <p> </p>; <p>People were motivated to watch television for reasons that had little to do with news, but in the process they ended up exposed to news content (Neuman et al., 1992). Many have argued that the move to an increasingly digital and increasingly high-choice media environment in the twenty-first century means that incidental exposure will wane, and selective exposure – where only those actively interested in seeking out news are exposed to it – will grow (Bennett and Iyengar, 2008).</p> <p>Though all three networks initially focussed on user-generated content, they now increasingly act as ‘intermediaries’ between established publishers and consumers (Nielsen and Ganter, 2017).</p> <p>In this article, we analyse whether the growing role of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube is increasing incidental exposure in a media environment otherwise increasingly characterized by selective exposure</p> <p>In the latter part of the twentieth century, many countries transitioned from low choice to high choice media environments, first with the introduction of cable television, and later with the growth of the web. This prompted debates over whether greater choice and availability meant that people would self-select away from news.</p> <p>Prior (2005) argued that content preferences become more important in high choice environments. Based on data on television viewers in the USA, he showed that those with stronger preferences for entertainment self-selected away from news, with the effect of lowering political knowledge and turnout, with only those most interested in politics benefitting from the wealth of available information.</p> <p>Others have argued that the way people use the web means that although it is undoubtedly a high choice environment where attention is often directed towards particular tasks, the potential for incidental exposure to news still exists. In an earlier study, Tewksbury et al. (2001) found a link between Internet use and political knowledge, attributing this to incidental exposure to news on web portals (such as Yahoo! and Lycos) favoured by early users.</p> <p>More recently, the increased use of social media has sparked fears that a process of self-selection reinforced by ever more responsive and sophisticated algorithmic selection will create echo chambers, or worse, trap people inside “filter bubbles”, where they will only ever be shown more of the things they already like, with the things they do not like hidden from them (Pariser, 2011).</p> <p>Most of this research, however, does not confirm people’s worst fears. Messing and Westwood (2014) found that social media often provides users with information from politically heterogeneous sources</p> <p><strong>Flaxman et al. (2016) examined the web histories of 50,000 internet users and found that while social media users tend to be more polarized, they are nonetheless exposed to more content from the other side of the political spectrum.</strong></p> <p>Compared with what they would see if they were friends with a random selection of Facebook users, people in fact see slightly see less news from sources with different political views, primarily due to political homophily, but also to a lesser extent due to Facebook’s algorithms.This suggests that selective avoidance, friend selection (homophily), and algorithmic ranking all might have a small limiting effect.</p> <p>Importantly, in many of these studies, exposure to information on social media is compared with what we might think of as an idealised form of diversity, because it is not usually possible to use the data to make comparisons with what people who do not use social media experience.</p> <p>Focussing on incidental exposure to news is one way of approaching this broader issue. The potential for incidental exposure to news on social media clearly exists, simply because people use it for a variety of reasons, and are not in complete control of what they see. Data from 2012 showed that only 18% of social media users in the USA unfollowed or unfriended others because of political content they had posted (Pew, 2012a).</p> <p>Despite this, however, other studies concluded that social media use does not lead to significant increases in political learning (Bode, 2016a; Bowyer et al., 2015).</p> <p>we should also take seriously the idea that this potential may not be realised, either because people’s networks are dominated by likeminded users, because they have customised their settings to minimize the amount of news they see, or because algorithms have become so responsive that they no longer surface anything that does not align with past behaviour.</p> <p>Our primary independent variable is type of social media use. This variable has three non-overlapping categories: non-users, the incidentally exposed, and news users.</p> <p>Propensity score matching ensures that differences found between categories of respondent are unrelated to other variables included in analysis by trimming the dataset so that each respondent within a category based on the independent variable is matched with one respondent in the other group that has similar observed characteristics. This process was performed using the ‘MatchIt’ package for the statistical language R, using the ‘nearest neighbour’ approach.</p> <p>Either way, this means that incidental exposure to news via social media could potentially reduce knowledge gaps that result from self-selection away from news (Prior, 2005), particularly in societies with low information opportunities (Esser et al., 2012),</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KSLL3WAV\Fletcher и Nielsen - 2018 - Are people incidentally exposed to news on social .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we develop network-based methods that operate on the ways in which users share content; we construct \emph{invocation graphs} on Web domains showing the extent to which pages from one domain are invoked by users to reply to posts containing pages from other domains. When we locate the domains on a political spectrum induced from the data, we obtain an embedded graph showing how these interaction links span different distances on the spectrum. The structure of this embedded network, and its evolution over time, helps us derive macro-level insights about how political interaction unfolded through 2016, leading up to the US Presidential election. In particular, we find that the domains invoked in replies spanned increasing distances on the spectrum over the months approaching the election, and that there was clear asymmetry between the left-to-right and right-to-left patterns of linkage.","2018","2019-02-14 08:31:59","2019-02-14 08:31:59","2019-02-14 08:31:59","629-638","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1802.09597","<p>Comment: The Web Conference 2018 (WWW 2018)</p>; <p>Political interaction has long constituted a key use of social media,<br />and there is a correspondingly rich history of research into its<br />structure — one that extends the much longer history of scholarship<br />on the role of media in the political process [6, 14, 23, 25].<br />A crucial issue in this line of work is the extent to which political<br />interaction on social media takes place primarily among users who<br />are ideologically similar, or whether it reaches across the political<br />spectrum.</p> <p>Early analysis of political blogging indicated a clustered<br />structure, with a high density of linkage among ideologically similar<br />blogs and a lower density of linkage between blogs with strongly<br />differing views [1].

"AIYFBF62","book","2011","Pariser, Eli","The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think","","978-1-101-51512-9","","","","An eye-opening account of how the hidden rise of personalization on the Internet is controlling-and limiting-the information we consume.   In December 2009, Google began customizing its search results for each user. Instead of giving you the most broadly popular result, Google now tries to predict what you are most likely to click on. According to MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser, Google's change in policy is symptomatic of the most significant shift to take place on the Web in recent years-the rise of personalization. In this groundbreaking investigation of the new hidden Web, Pariser uncovers how this growing trend threatens to control how we consume and share information as a society-and reveals what we can do about it.  Though the phenomenon has gone largely undetected until now, personalized filters are sweeping the Web, creating individual universes of information for each of us. Facebook-the primary news source for an increasing number of Americans-prioritizes the links it believes will appeal to you so that if you are a liberal, you can expect to see only progressive links. Even an old-media bastion like The Washington Post devotes the top of its home page to a news feed with the links your Facebook friends are sharing. Behind the scenes a burgeoning industry of data companies is tracking your personal information to sell to advertisers, from your political leanings to the color you painted your living room to the hiking boots you just browsed on Zappos.  In a personalized world, we will increasingly be typed and fed only news that is pleasant, familiar, and confirms our beliefs-and because these filters are invisible, we won't know what is being hidden from us. Our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for the unexpected encounters that spark creativity, innovation, and the democratic exchange of ideas.  While we all worry that the Internet is eroding privacy or shrinking our attention spans, Pariser uncovers a more pernicious and far- reaching trend on the Internet and shows how we can- and must-change course. With vivid detail and remarkable scope, The Filter Bubble reveals how personalization undermines the Internet's original purpose as an open platform for the spread of ideas and could leave us all in an isolated, echoing world.","2011-05-12","2019-02-09 05:34:29","2019-02-09 05:34:29","","","223","","","","","The Filter Bubble","","","","","Penguin","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wcalrOI1YbQC","<p>Заметки</p> <p>Книжка, в которой был впервые использован термин filter bubble</p>","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=wcalrOI1YbQC","","Business & Economics / Consumer Behavior; Business & Economics / E-Commerce / General; Technology & Engineering / Telecommunications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our context-neutral laboratory experimental treatments mimic the features of social networks in the presence of media bias to address concerns that voters getting political news via social media may become more polarized in their voting behavior. Our results suggest that these concerns are warranted: subjects selectively share news that is favorable to their party and do not account for biased news signals in their voting decisions. Overall, subjects behave as if news sharing and voting expresses their induced partisanship even though by design, their preferences have a common value component. Given these patterns of individual behavior, the welfare implications of social networks reﬂect the underlying quality of the shared news: with unbiased media, social networks raise collective decision making eﬃciency, but eﬃciency deteriorates markedly in the presence of media bias, as news signals become less reliable.","","2019-02-09 05:31:22","2019-02-09 05:31:22","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Given these patterns of individual behavior,<br />the welfare implications of social networks re<br />ect the underlying quality of the shared news:<br />with unbiased media, social networks raise collective decision making eciency, but eciency<br />deteriorates markedly in the presence of media bias, as news signals become less reliable.</p> <p>We also nd that social networks amplify the underlying quality of the shared news: Without<br />media bias, social networks raise collective decision making eciency.

Political discussions on these platforms are becoming an<br />increasingly relevant source of political information, often also<br />used as a source of quotes for media outlets (Jürgens, Jungherr, &amp;<br />Schoen, 2011). Traditional media are declining in their gatekeeping<br />role to determine the agenda and select which issues and viewpoints<br />reach their audiences (Bruns, 2011).</p> <p>Communication theorists argue that the traditional media are<br />declining in their gatekeeping role to determine what is ‘‘newsworthy’’<br />and select which issues and viewpoints will reach their<br />audiences Bruns (2011).</p> <p>Many scholars<br />characterize the online media landscape as the ‘‘age of plenty, with<br />an almost infinite choice and unparalleled pluralization of voices<br />that have access to the public sphere (Karppinen, 2009). Some<br />argue that social media will disrupt the traditional elite control<br />of media and amplify the political voice of non-elites and<br />minorities (Castells, 2011).</p> <p>As a<br />result, the information curated through collaborative action on<br />such social media platforms should be expected to be drawn from<br />a diverse, multi-perspectival range of sources (Bruns, 2011). Some<br />further claim that platforms such as Twitter are neutral communication<br />spaces, and offer a unique environment in which journalists<br />are free to communicate virtually anything to anyone, beyond<br />many of the natural constraints posed by organizational norms<br />that are existing in traditional media (Lasorsa, Lewis, &amp; Holton,<br />2012).</p> <p>On the other hand, there are skeptical voices that argue that<br />the Internet has not fundamentally changed the concentrated<br />structure typical of mass media, but reflects the previously recognized<br />inequalities (Karppinen, 2009). It is also argued that it has<br />brought about new forms of exclusion and hierarchy (Suoranta<br />&amp; Vadén, 2009). While it has increased some sort of political participation,<br />it has empowered a small set of elites and they still<br />strongly shape how political material is presented and accessed<br />(Hindman, 2008). Others have pointed out the danger of ‘‘cyberbalkanization’’<br />caused by the Internet (Sunstein, 2002; Pariser,<br />2011).</p> <p>As we will argue,<br />marginalized members of segregated groups, structurally<br />underprivileged actors and minorities must receive special attention<br />and just measuring number of available sources will not<br />guarantee viewpoint diversity.</p> <p>In this paper, we contribute with a framework to analyze and<br />understand the impact of political culture in Twitter. Rather than<br />reducing the concept viewpoint diversity to a single quantity or<br />metric, we introduce different dimensions of viewpoint diversity,<br />based on previous studies and the theory from communication<br />studies and political philosophy.</p> <p>According to Bakshy et al. (2012), even<br />though people are more likely to consume and share information<br />that comes from close contacts that they interact with frequently,<br />the vast majority of information comes from contacts that they<br />interact with infrequently. These so-called ‘‘weak-ties’’<br />(Granovetter, 1981) are also more likely to share novel information.</p> <p>Twitter, with its API, provides an excellent environment for<br />information diversity research.</p> <p>Sun et al. (2013) performed an empirical<br />study using statistical models to identify serendipity in Twitter<br />and Weibo. Using likelihood ratio test and by measuring unexpectedness<br />and relevance, they observe high levels of serendipity in<br />information diffusion in microblogging communities.</p> <p>Further, they observed that all influential British Twitter users<br />(mainstream media, journalists and celebrities) display some kind<br />of bias towards a particular political party in their tweets. Jürgens<br />et al. (2011) shows that certain individual German Twitter users<br />act as gatekeepers, especially in the distribution of political information.<br />Those users are also not neutral hubs. They tend to curate<br />political information and post-messages that they find important<br />(Jürgens et al., 2011).</p> <p>Following Napoli (1999), we may distinguish three different<br />dimensions of information diversity. The first dimension is source<br />diversity, which is diversity in terms of outlets (cables and channel<br />owners) or program producers (content owners). Content diversity<br />consists of diversity in format (program-type), demographic (in<br />terms of racial, ethnic, and gender), and idea-viewpoint (of social,<br />political and cultural perspectives). The third dimension, exposure<br />diversity, deals with audience reach and whether users have actually<br />consumed a diverse set of items.</p> <p>To our knowledge, this is the first work<br />that provides an overview of all the used metrics in social media<br />analytics literature and the first study to apply an ‘‘openness’’ metric.</p> <p> </p>; <p>Заметки</p> <p>The article presents a good overview of academic diccussion in the effects of social media on public discourse and democracy.</p> <p>Also, there is a precise and compact argument about importance of information diversity for different models of democracy.</p> <p>Authors explain the difference between being subjected to diverse information and there may be a bias against the views and opinions from minorities.</p> <p>They discuss different modes of informational divercity, specifically, source, content and reach diversity. They cite Karpinnen's idea that informational diversity should not be measured in terms of content and sources, but rather in equal opportunities for different social groups, especially underpriveleged ones.</p> <p>These ‘‘minorities’’ must be politically mobilized and included<br />as equals in a process of discussing issues (Young, 2002).<br /><br /></p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NPK8CXDY\bozdag2014-1.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DKHWHL6W\S0747563214003069.html","","","Diversity; Netherlands; Polarization; Politics; Turkey; Twitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facebook’s influence as a channel for the circulation of news has come under intense scrutiny recently, especially with regard to the dissemination of false stories. While this criticism has focused on the ‘filter bubbles’ created by the site’s personalisation algorithms, our research indicates that users’ own actions also play a key role in how the site operates as a forum for debate.

Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation.

This study aimed to disentangle age, period and birth cohort effects for the first time in Russia to improve our understanding of these trends. Design Age, period and cohort analysis of annual nationally representative repeated cross-sectional surveys (RLMS-HSE) using separate logistic models for each gender. Setting Russia 1994-2016. Participants A total of 195234 respondents aged 14-85 years. Measurements Age (14 groups: 14-17 to 75+ years), period (21 years: 1994 to 2016) and birth cohorts (17 groups: 1920-24 to 2000-02). Outcome measures were 30-day overall and beverage-specific alcohol use prevalence accounting for vodka, moonshine, beer and wine. Controls were per capita income, education, marital status, ethnicity, residence type and regional climate. Findings Controlling for age and period effects, the most recent cohorts had lower rates of participation than older cohorts. Findings were valid for females born in 1995-2002 (P=0.000) and males born in 1990-94 (P=0.002) and 1995-2002 (P=0.000). The period effects were strong in 1994-2003 due to intensive substitution of beer in place of vodka. Period effects were also important in determining a decline of prevalence in 2008-15 due to restrictive alcohol policy. Age effects showed an inverse u-shaped trend in both genders, except for moonshine and wine. Overall, drinking profiles were beverage-specific. Models indicated diverse beverage-specific effects of income, ethnicity, education, marital status and residence on the prevalence of alcohol use. Conclusion The recent downward trend in alcohol use in Russia appears to be attributable to reduced participation rates among younger cohorts born after 1990.","2018-12-15","2018-12-23 11:13:34","2018-12-23 11:13:34","","","","","","","Addiction","Young Cohorts of Russians Drink Less","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30552861","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552861","","age-period-cohort modelling; Alcohol use prevalence; repeated cross-sectional; Russia; trends; youth drinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: We analyzed national injury mortality data from coroner, census, and college enrollment statistics, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2005, percentages of emerging adults ages 18-24 reporting past-month heavy episodic drinking rose from 37.1% to 43.1% and then declined to 38.8% in 2014. Alcohol-impaired driving rose from 24% to 25.5% and then declined to 16.0%. Alcohol-related unintentional injury deaths increased from 4,807 in 1998 to 5,531 in 2005 and then declined to 4,105 in 2014, a reduction of 29% per 100,000 since 1998. Alcohol-related traffic deaths increased from 3,783 in 1998 to 4,114 in 2005 and then declined to 2,614 in 2014, down 43% per 100,000 since 1998. Alcohol-related overdose deaths increased from 207 in 1998 to 891 in 2014, a 254% increase per 100,000. Other types of nontraffic unintentional injury deaths declined. Alcohol-overdose hospitalizations rose 26% per 100,000 from 1998 to 2014, especially from increases in alcohol/other drug overdoses, up 61% (alcohol/opioid overdoses up 197%). CONCLUSIONS: Among emerging adults, a trend toward increased alcohol-related unintentional injury deaths, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol-impaired driving between 1998 and 2005 was reversed by 2014. Persistent high levels of heavy episodic drinking and related problems among emerging adults underscore a need to expand individually oriented interventions, college/community collaborative programs, and evidence-supported policies to reduce their drinking and related problems.","2017","2018-12-23 11:05:19","2018-12-23 11:05:19","","540-548","","4","78","","J Stud Alcohol Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28728636 PMCID: PMC5551659","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28728636","","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Analgesics, Opioid; Automobile Driving; Cause of Death; Drug Overdose; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; United States; Universities; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YW7CYI2A","journalArticle","","Cheung, Christy; Lee, Matthew K O","Trust in Internet Shopping: A Proposed Model and Measurement Instrument","","","","","","Despite the phenomenal growth of Internet users in recent years, the penetration rate of Internet shopping is still very low and one of most often cited reasons is the lack of consumers’ trust [e.g. Hoffman et al., 1999]. Although trust is an important concept in Internet shopping, there is a paucity of theory-guided empirical research in this area. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed for investigating the nature of trust in the specific context of Internet shopping. In this model, consumers’ trust in Internet shopping is affected by two groups of antecedent factors, namely, “trustworthiness of Internet vendors” and “external environment”. In addition, the effects of these factors on trust are moderated by the consumers’ propensity to trust. Trust, in turn, reduces consumers’ perceived risk in Internet shopping. As a step towards the rigorous testing of the model, a 30-item measurement instrument has been developed with its reliability and validity empirically tested. This research contributes to the development of trust theory in e-commerce and provides a validated instrument for the measurement of various important trust related constructs.","","2018-09-09 11:06:14","2018-09-09 11:06:14","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\B8WW56Q5\Cheung и Lee - Trust in Internet Shopping A Proposed Model and M.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We enrolled male patients who were diagnosed with IGD, GD or AUD, with 15 patients per group, as well as 15 HCs. Trait impulsivity was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version 11 (BIS-11). The stop-signal test (SST) from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was used to assess the patients’ abilities to inhibit prepotent responses. Compulsivity was measured using the intra–extra dimensional set shift (IED) test from the CANTAB. The Trail Making Test (TMT) was also used in this study. Results: The IGD and AUD groups scored significantly higher on the BIS-11 as a whole than did the HC group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). The IGD and AUD groups also scored significantly higher on the BIS-11 as a whole than did the GD group (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, the GD group made significantly more errors (p = 0.017 and p = 0.022, respectively) and more individuals failed to achieve criterion on the IED test compared with the IGD and HC groups (p = 0.018 and p = 0.017, respectively). Discussion: These findings may aid in the understanding of not only the differences in categorical aspects between individuals with IGD and GD but also in impulsivity–compulsivity dimensional domains. Conclusion: Additional studies are needed to elucidate the neurocognitive characteristics of behavioral addictive disorders in terms of impulsivity and compulsivity.","2014-12","2018-09-02 06:50:56","2018-09-02 06:50:56","2018-09-02 06:50:56","246-253","","4","3","","","Similarities and differences among Internet gaming disorder, gambling disorder and alcohol use disorder","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KQWVUF8S\Choi и др. - 2014 - Similarities and differences among Internet gaming.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide.

Immigrant populations may face structural and individual barriers in the access to and navigation of healthcare services in a new country. The aims of the study were to (1) generate new understanding of the processes that perpetuate immigrant disadvantages in maternity healthcare, and (2) devise potential interventions that might improve maternity experiences and outcomes for immigrant women in Canada. Methods The study utilized a qualitative research approach that focused on ethnographic research design and data analysis contextualized within theories of organizational behaviour and critical realism. Data were collected over 2.5 years using focus groups and in-depth semistructured interviews with immigrant women (n = 34), healthcare providers (n = 29), and social service providers (n = 23) in a Canadian province. Purposive samples of each subgroup were generated, and recruitment and data collection – including interpretation and verification of translations – were facilitated through the hiring of community researchers and collaborations with key informants. Results The findings indicate that (a) communication difficulties, (b) lack of information, (c) lack of social support (isolation), (d) cultural beliefs, e) inadequate healthcare services, and (f) cost of medicine/services represent potential barriers to the access to and navigation of maternity services by immigrant women in Canada. Having successfully accessed and navigated services, immigrant women often face additional challenges that influence their level of satisfaction and quality of care, such as lack of understanding of the informed consent process, lack of regard by professionals for confidential patient information, short consultation times, short hospital stays, perceived discrimination/stereotyping, and culture shock. Conclusions Although health service organizations and policies strive for universality and equality in service provision, personal and organizational barriers can limit care access, adequacy, and acceptability for immigrant women. A holistic healthcare approach must include health informational packages available in different languages/media. Health care professionals who care for diverse populations must be provided with training in cultural competence, and monitoring and evaluation programs to ameliorate personal and systemic discrimination.","2016-01-27","2016-04-07 07:55:21","2016-04-07 07:55:21","2016-04-07 07:55:21","","","","16","","BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26818961 PMCID: PMC4729163","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Z9MENVPX\Higginbottom et al. - 2016 - An ethnographic investigation of the maternity hea.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4729163/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies of homeless children have described more health problems and service use than in housed children, but failed to control for potential confounding factors that may differ between these children. This observational study examines the relationship of homelessness and other determinants to health status and service use patterns in 627 homeless and low-income housed children. Methods. Case-control study of 293 homeless and 334 low-income housed children aged 3 months to 17 years and their mothers conducted in Worcester, Massachusetts. Information was collected about mothers' housing history, income, education, emotional distress, and victimization history. Standardized instruments were administered to assess children's health. Health service use questions were adapted from national surveys. Main outcome measures included health status, acute illness morbidity, emergency department and outpatient medical visits. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association of family and environmental determinants, including homelessness, with health status and service use outcomes. Results. Mothers of homeless children were more likely to report their children as being in fair or poor health compared with their housed counterparts. Homeless children were reported to experience a higher number of acute illness symptoms, including fever, ear infection, diarrhea, and asthma. Emergency department and outpatient medical visits were higher among the homeless group. After controlling for potential explanatory factors, homeless children remained more likely to experience fair or poor health status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16, 4.87), and a higher frequency of outpatient (OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.18, 2.48) and emergency department visits (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.83, 1.74). Mothers' emotional distress was independently associated with acute illness symptoms and frequent use of outpatient and emergency department settings. Conclusions. Homelessness is an independent predictor of poor health status and high service use among children. The present findings highlight the importance of preventive interventions and efforts to increase access to primary care among homeless children.","1998-09-01","2016-04-05 17:44:34","2016-04-05 17:44:34","2016-04-05 17:44:34","554-562","","3","102","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 1998 American Academy of Pediatrics","","","","pediatrics.aappublications.org","","PMID: 9738176","","; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\T9BZ7V7R\554.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9738176","","children; health; health services; homelessness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Community of Worcester, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS A sample of 220 homeless mothers and 216 low-income housed mothers receiving welfare. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Outcome measures included health status, chronic conditions, adverse lifestyle practices, outpatient and emergency department use and hospitalization rates, and use of preventive screening measures. Both homeless mothers and housed mothers demonstrated low levels of physical and role functioning and high levels of bodily pain. Prevalence rates of asthma, anemia, and ulcer disease were high in both groups. More than half of both groups were current smokers. Compared with the housed mothers, homeless mothers reported more HIV risk behaviors. Although 90% of the homeless mothers had been screened for cervical cancer, almost one third had not been screened for tuberculosis. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the homeless mothers, compared with the housed mothers, had more frequent emergency department visits in the past year (adjusted mean, homeless vs housed, 1.41 vs .95, p = .10) and were significantly more likely to be hospitalized in the past year (adjusted odds ratio 2.22; 95% confidence interval 1.13, 4.38). CONCLUSIONS Both homeless mothers and low-income housed mothers had lower health status, more chronic health problems, and higher smoking rates than the general population. High rates of hospitalization, emergency department visits, and more risk behaviors among homeless mothers suggest that they are at even greater risk of adverse health outcomes. Efforts to address gaps in access to primary care and to integrate psychosocial supports with health care delivery may improve health outcomes for homeless mothers and reduce use of costly medical care services.","1998-06","2016-04-05 17:33:41","2016-04-05 17:33:41","2016-04-05 17:33:41","389-397","","6","13","","J Gen Intern Med","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 9669568 PMCID: PMC1496974","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WSBS8AEZ\Weinreb et al. - 1998 - Health Characteristics and Medical Service Use Pat.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1496974/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ульянов-Ленин в «Материализме и эмпириокритицизме» (1908) практически поставил идеи Юма под запрет для всех ортодоксально мыслящих марксистов. Отсюда и постоянно сдерживание всех попыток ассимиляции в российском марксизме ведущих англо-американских эпистемологических тенденций XX в., в той или иной мере инспирированных идеями Юм</p> <p><em>Главная проблема Юма - вопрос о природе знания, и он подталкивает читателя к самостоятельному поиску способов разрешения противоречий.</em></p> <p><strong>Ключевая тема эпистемологии Юма: </strong>знание (идеи) никогда не содержит ничего нового по сравнению с впечатлениями, а следовательно, говорить о процессе познания как о переходе от незнания к знанию, о приращении знания невозможно</p> <p><em>Хорошая формулировка - учение Юма особенно оригинально в век торжества разума. Разумеется, не понято, да только вот откуда оно взялось?</em></p> <p><em></em><strong>Актуализация проблемы причинности:<br /></strong></p> <p>Нововременной этап проблематизации причинности связан с концепцией Юма. Она и сегодня, по убеждению представителей аналитической философии, является основой для обсуждения этой проблемы. До этого причинность долгое время считалась предметом исключительно метафизики. Даже Кант называл ее метафизической. По утверждению Г.Г. Шпета, «началом новой разработки проблемы надо считать вопрос о ценности <em>понят</em></p> <p><strong>И - отлично, подтверждение моей мысли о необходимости понимания ""посредников"", для актуализации идей Юма, что произошло лишь с появлением социологии, психологии, нейрофизиологии и т.д.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>Юм не находит источника знания <em>внутри</em> узко понятой человеческой природы именно потому, что его там нет. И в этом он значительно умнее некоторых современных когнитивистов, ищущих сознание в мозгу. Источник и знания, и сознания находится за пределами человеческого тела, он в деятельностном взаимодействии с миром и другими людьми.</p> <p>Может быть, сюда следует приплести и Адама Смита, с его идеей про Interdependent</p> <p><strong>По поводу языка в философии Юма:</strong></p> <p>Выясняется, что понятия смысла и значения, находящиеся в фокусе внимания философии языка, обстоятельно обсуждаются Юмом при различении впечатлений, идей и абстрактных идей</p> <p><strong>Утверждение о том, что проблематика аналитической философии инспирирована идеями Юма</strong><strong></strong>Достоверность знания, различие типов и методов познания (интуиции и умозаключения, индукции и дедукции), соотношения истины и заблуждения, опыта и&nbsp; понятия - вся эта проблематика принадлежит к «жесткому ядру» классической эпистемологии и во многом инспирирована работами Юма</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Важная мысль: у Юма иногда проскальзывает понимание того, что значение может изменяться. То есть, ростки современной эпистемы:</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>Оказывается, слово может быть не просто осмысленно или бессмысленно, но значение способно к содержательному изменению. Вот цитата: «...пользуясь всеми этими выражениями в <em>указанном применении</em>, мы в действительности не придаем им точного смысла, но лишь употребляем привычные слова, не соединяя с ними ясных и определенных идей. Однако более вероятно, что данные выражения теряют здесь свой истинный смысл в силу неверного их применения, чем в силу того, что у них совсем нет никакого смысла» [Юм 2009, кн. I, 245-246].</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>обескураживающие выводы самого Юма не особенно смущают. Они и следующий из них скептицизм являются, в сущности, уроком скромности для познающего субъекта, которому не следует преувеличивать возможности своего разума, воодушевляться мифами и идеологемами, переоценивать наличное состояние науки и вообще сохранять критическую установку - первое оружие настоящего философа</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MB3UDZ5N\index.html","","Юм, Давид","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shortlisted for the Saltire Society Scottish Research Book of the Year 2009 This is the first-ever account of the full 700-year-old Scottish philosophical tradition. The book focuses on a number of philosophers in the period from the later-13th century until the mid-20th and attends especially to some brilliantly original texts. The book also indicates ways in which philosophy has been intimately related to other aspects of Scotland's culture. Among the greatest philosophers that Scotland has produced are John Duns Scotus, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith and Thomas Reid.

Immigrant populations may face structural and individual barriers in the access to and navigation of healthcare services in a new country. The aims of the study were to (1) generate new understanding of the processes that perpetuate immigrant disadvantages in maternity healthcare, and (2) devise potential interventions that might improve maternity experiences and outcomes for immigrant women in Canada. Methods: The study utilized a qualitative research approach that focused on ethnographic research design and data analysis contextualized within theories of organizational behaviour and critical realism. Data were collected over 2.5 years using focus groups and in-depth semistructured interviews with immigrant women (n = 34), healthcare providers (n = 29), and social service providers (n = 23) in a Canadian province. Purposive samples of each subgroup were generated, and recruitment and data collection - including interpretation and verification of translations - were facilitated through the hiring of community researchers and collaborations with key informants. Results: The findings indicate that (a) communication difficulties, (b) lack of information, (c) lack of social support (isolation), (d) cultural beliefs, e) inadequate healthcare services, and (f) cost of medicine/services represent potential barriers to the access to and navigation of maternity services by immigrant women in Canada. Having successfully accessed and navigated services, immigrant women often face additional challenges that influence their level of satisfaction and quality of care, such as lack of understanding of the informed consent process, lack of regard by professionals for confidential patient information, short consultation times, short hospital stays, perceived discrimination/stereotyping, and culture shock. Conclusions: Although health service organizations and policies strive for universality and equality in service provision, personal and organizational barriers can limit care access, adequacy, and acceptability for immigrant women. A holistic healthcare approach must include health informational packages available in different languages/media. Health care professionals who care for diverse populations must be provided with training in cultural competence, and monitoring and evaluation programs to ameliorate personal and systemic discrimination. © 2016 Higginbottom et al.","2016","2016-03-15 06:52:07","2016-03-15 10:04:39","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","<p>Заметки для консультации с Джин и для курсеры</p> <p><strong>Для Курсеры</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>; <p><strong>Общее описание статьи</strong></p> <p>Исследование посвящено вопросу о том, какие препятствия возникают перед иммигрантами, в процессе получения медицинских услуг.

A small study is described in which nurses were invited to describes their response to their perception that a parent wanted to increase or decrease her or his involvement in her or his child's care The critical incident technique (Flanagan 1954) was used to collect data Nurses' responses were categorized into categories of ‘encouragement’, ‘explanation/advice’ and ‘negotiation’. Responses were then placed in more specific subcategones The inter-rater reliability of the categorization was measured. Owing to the limitations of the study, the results can only be regarded as suggestive. Nevertheless, significant association was found between the category of response and the grade of staff, with a stratified pattern of category of response demonstrated The implications of the study for future research are discussed.","1991","2016-03-09 12:38:42","2016-03-09 12:38:42","2016-03-09 12:38:42","772-781","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VVENV7RS\abstract.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their underpinning condition often severely compromises their ability to express pain through the usual verbal and behavioural routes. The lack of any appropriate framework for assessment results in a suboptimum and inaccurate approach to an important aspect of their care. Purpose. The purpose of the study was to explore the ways in which parents of children with profound special needs assess and manage their children's pain. Methods. Qualitative case study design underpinned the study using guided interviews with the 15 parents/carers (of 12 children aged 5–16 years with profound special needs). Ethical approval. Ethics Committee approval was gained. Findings. A number of themes emerged from the data including learning to live with pain, dealing with uncertainty, expression of pain and making decisions. Conclusions. Parents felt that their child had learned to live with significant levels of chronic and acute pain. Assessment of pain was an uncertain and complex process requiring parents to draw on skills and knowledge developed over a number of years. Parents used different strategies for both the assessment and management of pain based on an intimate knowledge of their child's usual nonpain state. Even with a limited repertoire of behaviours available to them, children were able to express pain. Parents often felt isolated in relation to pain management and under-used as a resource by health professionals.","2002","2016-03-09 12:36:37","2016-03-09 12:36:37","2016-03-09 12:36:37","449-457","","5","38","","","Dealing with uncertainty","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\T6KP75CH\Carter et al. - 2002 - Dealing with uncertainty parental assessment of p.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9JPS5URC\abstract.html","","","children; assessment; disability; management; pain; profound special needs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, authors from different professional and policy perspectives have used different definitions and literatures when arguing the evidence for FCC and FCS. Method  A critical literature review and theoretical discussion exploring common concepts and issues forming the basis for a research agenda further strengthening of the evidence base for FCC. A systematic identification of constructs, concepts and empirical indicators is developed and applied to exemplars in pain and asthma that span the continuum of children's healthcare across acute and community settings. Conclusions  The extent to which the concepts are supported by research and applied in practice remains unclear. We propose that re-thinking of FCC is required in order to develop a more coherent programme of research into the application of FCC theory in children's healthcare.","2004","2016-03-09 12:34:21","2016-03-09 12:34:21","2016-03-09 12:34:21","265-277","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8WA9M5ET\Franck и Callery - 2004 - Re-thinking family-centred care across the continu.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\58JW2C2E\abstract;jsessionid=C2188E04E45DC3A01659333D59A63C01.html","","","family involvement; family nursing; family–professional relations; patient-centred care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, many families have insufficient knowledge of parenting skills and an inadequate support system of friends, extended family, or professionals to help with these vital tasks.

The purpose of our study was to assess the impact of families' participation in a home-visitation program offered by a central Kentucky health department on parental risk factors. A family social worker or nurse interviewed parents pre-intervention, completing a Parent Survey which assessed multiple parental risk factors associated with negative health and well-being and to calculate a total risk score. Upon exiting the program, parents are re-interviewed to document improvements, review progress and accomplished goals, plan for transitional services, and calculate a new risk score. As of December 2010, 64 families had completed the home-visitation program and had pre- and post-risk scores available for analysis. Based on paired-sample t tests, there was a statistically significant difference in total mean risk scores among both mothers and fathers from pre to post. The McNemar-Bowker test also revealed statistically different scores for four of the six risk factors for mothers and fathers pre- and post-home-visitation: lifestyle behaviors and mental health, coping skills and support systems, stresses, and anger management skills. Findings suggest that families who were deemed at-risk for adverse pregnancy and child health outcomes benefit from participation in the home-visitation program. Programs designed to promote positive pregnancy outcomes and child development may benefit from providing social support, fostering parental knowledge, skill development and problem solving, insuring proper medical care, and connecting parents with community resources. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2013","2016-03-09 11:07:25","2016-03-09 11:07:25","","551-558","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\U8EDCHXI\display.html","","HV prog effect","Home visitation; Kentucky; Local health department; Maternal and child health; Parental risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

И в ответах на такие вопросы в одном ряду с Платоном, Аристотелем и Кантом мы обязательно встречаем упоминания о Юме[1]. И это, если вдуматься, не должно казаться неожиданным. Он смело разрушал старую метафизику и открывал новые пути мысли, изобретал блестящие аргументы и оставил целые россыпи идей. Его идеи пробудили от «догматического сна» Канта и породили школу философов «здравого смысла», он вдохновлял своими сочинениями таких разных мыслителей, как Шопенгауэр и Бентам, Гуссерль и Айер, Деннет и Делез. Эпистемологические находки Юма заложили фундамент аналитических теорий значения, его учение о причинности стало основой современной онтологии, а его рассуждения на теологические темы предвосхищали новейшую философию религии. Не забывали Юма и за пределами философии. Так, Эйнштейн говорил, что изучение текстов Юма подтолкнуло его к созданию теории относительности, а Дарвин разделял его видение человеческой природы. Значение Юма связано не только с его метафизическими трактатами. Его политические сочинения повлияли на создателей конституции США, его «История Англии» долгое время считалась эталоном в своем жанре, а его вклад в шотландскую культуру настолько велик, что соотечественники назвали Юма «Шотландцем тысячелетия» и установили ему памятник в самом центре Эдинбурга.</p> </div>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XZ2T7J7K\index.html","","Юм, Давид","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TGAER8IK","book","2011","Garthoff, Raymond","Reflections on the Cuban Missile Crisis","","978-0-8157-1739-3","","","","The Soviet response to the first edition of Reflections has been a prime example of the new openness under glasnost in discussing previously taboo subjects. Using new revelationsÑsuch as the fact that Moscow had twice as many troops in Cuba as the Kennedy administration believedÑfrom key Soviet and Cuban Sources, Garthoff has revised his earlier analysis to produce the most accurate, eye-opening story yet of the 1963 crisis. In this book Raymond L. Garthoff, a participant in the crisis deliberations of the U.S. government, reflects on the nature of the crisis, it&#39;s consequences, and it&#39;s lessons for the future. He provides a unique combination of memoir, historical analysis, and political interpretations. He gives particular attention to the aftermath and &quot;afterlife&quot; of the crisis and to its bearing on current and future policy. In the first edition of the book in 1987 the Garthoff presented a number of facts for the first time. Since then, more information has become available, particularly form Soviet sources, in part from conferences in which Garthoff participated but even more from individual interviews and research. This new information, much of it presented here in this volume for the first time, helps to fill in gaps in our knowledge about events and motivations on the Soviet side. More importantly, it enlarges our understanding of the crisis interaction.","2011-03-01","2016-02-03 10:06:32","2016-02-05 08:28:17","","","254","","","","","","","","","","Brookings Institution Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","<p>Много по этой теме.

Коллинз, один из наиболее живых и увлекательных авторов в области социологии, прослеживает идейные вехи на пути этих четырех магистральных школ от классических теорий до их современных разработок. Он рассказывает об истоках социологии, указывая на области, в которых был достигнут прогресс в нашем понимании социальной реальности, области, где еще существуют расхождения, и направление, в котором движется социология.","2009","2016-01-31 07:27:53","2016-01-31 07:30:50","","","318","","","","","","Университетская библиотека Александра Погорельского","","","","Территория будущего","Москва","ru","","","","","OZON.ru","","","","","","","","","","Россман, Вадим","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Фуко исследует<br />здесь те исторически изменяющиеся структуры (по его<br />выражению, «исторические априори), которые определяют условия<br />возможности мнений, теорий или даже наук в каждый исторический<br />период, и называет их «эпистемами». Фуко противопоставляет<br />«археологию», которая вычленяет эти структуры, эти<br />эпистемы, историческому знанию кумулятивистского типа, которое<br />описывает те или иные мнения, не выясняя условий их возможности.<br />Основной упорядочивающий принцип внутри каждой<br />эпистемы — это соотношение «слов» и «вещей». Соответственно<br />различию в этом отношении Фуко вычленяет в европейской<br />культуре нового времени три «эпистемы»: ренессансную<br />(XVI век), классическую (рационализм XVII—XVIII веков) и<br />современную (с конца XVIII — начала XIX века и по настоящее<br />время).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Ключевое своймтво классической эпистемы - непрерывность соотношения бытия и представления.

Характерная черта современной эпистемы —<br />это появление жизни, труда, языка в их внутренней силе, в их<br />собственном бытии, законы которого не сводимы к логическим<br />законам мышления.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline; background-color: #888888;"">Ключевые установки современной эпистемы сами по себе являются ответом на гносеологический кризис, обозначенный Юмом:</span></p> <p>репрезентация, представление, лишается<br />своей синтезирующей роли в пространстве познания: смыслы<br />в языке начинают определяться через грамматическую систему,<br />обмен товаров — через труд</p> <p><em>У самого Фуко эта же идея содержится на странице 108<br /></em></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Конец классической эпистемы у Канта</span></p> <p><em>Я бы сказал, что он скорее уже начинает современную эпистему.

Оценкой утомления систем жизнеобеспечения (СЖО) Сибири - самоорганизации потока (политического, экономического, социально-культурного) популяции в целях ее сохранения и развития, по существу, никто не занимается.Системы оценки утомления нации нет.</p> <p>Есть оценка по функциям, но сложение этих функций неарифметическое: при улучшении одной функции, другая - будет ухудшаться. Это холистическая (hole - англ., целый) концепция в экологии. У нас нет хороших теорий интеграции нелинейных процессов (катастроф) в утомлении СЖО, по Сибири тем более. Это ведет к потерям трудоресурсов. Например, по крайнему Северу осталось менее 20% необходимого оборудования, обеспечивающего народопроживание. Мы проиграли по Северам на ближайшие 20 лет примерно 500 млрд. долларов,</p> <p>заморозив северные селительные, производственные и транспортные</p> <p>зоны. Предупреждение нелинейных процессов (катастроф) и снижение коэффициента утомления СЖО (система жизнеобеспечения) возможно при комплексном подходе по следующим основным направлениям:</p> <p>1. Система воспитания, жизненная установка.</p> <p>2. Система обучения, система тренировок, игр.</p> <p>стр 8-9</p> <p>3. Управление системой СЖО в соответствии взаимозависимости ее конструкций, процессов, экологии, сезонности.</p> <p>4. Организация единого центра СЖО возможных прогнозов нелинейных процессов (прогнозирование, профилактика).</p> <p>5. Реорганизация центра (программы) здоровья народонаселения областей (городов) на основе единых показателей СЖО, человекопотребления, человекопроизводства.</p> <p>6. Расширение программ воспитания молодежи, образования семей.</p> <p>7. Новые меры профилактики нелинейных процессов (СЖО).</p> <p>Нам необходимо помнить, что целью сохранения и развития нации являются социальное воспроизводство (воспитание, образование), человекопроизводство, природопроизводство. Производство энергии, сырья, товаров, пищи, человекопотребление и природопотребление</p> <p>8</p> <p>являются лишь средством достижения этой цели (ноосферная демократия).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>; <p>Нам сегодня нельзя соглашаться с идеями т. н. стабильного разви-</p> <p>тия общества. Расчеты показывают, что некой стабильности в нашем</p> <p>обществе быть не может. Если стабильность принять как стратегию, то</p> <p>вернется раскол общества, поляризация диктатуры. Мы должны гово-</p> <p>рить не об устойчивом развитии, а о стратегиях выживания челове-</p> <p>чества, о совокупных действиях, способных обеспечить коэволюцию</p> <p>человека и окружающей среды. Разработка такой концепции представ-</p> <p>ляется мне самой фундаментальной проблемой науки за всю историю.</p> <p>Если мы с вами &laquo;прозеваем&raquo; молодое поколение в воспитании и обра-</p> <p>зовании, то следующее поколение будет еще худшим по всем показа-</p> <p>телям. Таким образом, регистр выживания нации упирается во время</p> <p>жизни поколения. Это 22-25 лет. А если брать преемственность поко-</p> <p>лений, то это будет 2050-й год.</p> <p>Накопленные современные очень интересные данные и отечест-</p> <p>венными, и зарубежными исследователями, например [2, 3, 4], дают</p> <p>возможность выделить ту специфику, которая характеризует Евразий-</p> <p>скую часть России от Урала до Тихого океана, с ее природой и соци-</p> <p>альными особенностями, объединяющими в себе и Восток, и Запад,</p> <p>демографией, особенностями эволюции человеческих популяций в их</p> <p>многонациональном объединении. Мы наблюдаем уникальный феномен в мировой истории евразийства XXI века. Именно на анализе этого феномена мне бы и хотелось остановиться.</p> <p>Центром Брауна (США) проведены интересные исследования, на основе которых поверхность нашей планеты разделена на несколько регионов [51. В одних регионах происходит сокращение населения Земли (причем это характерно для регионов, достигших высокого культурного и экономического уровня); в других происходит бурный рост населения за счет снижения смертности и высокого уровня рождаемости; в третьих - идет вырождение населения вследствие переутомления, сырьевого использования природных богатств и образования дефицита источников поддержания жизни. Для эволюции человеческой популяции, народонаселения на Востоке страны характерно 6</p> <p>обеднение природной среды с точки зрения экологии. На сей день мы, без сомнения, подошли к такому состоянию, что в Зауралье возобладала тенденция резкого снижения репродуктивного человекопроизводственного потенциала.</p> <p>Демографические данные подтверждают национальную катастрофу (депопуляцию): снижение рождаемости, рост смертности (за счет постарения населения). На одну женщину детородного периода приходится 1 (1,1) ребенок, вместо 3 (3,7), и никакими наказами президента</p> <p>невозможно повысить рождаемость, потому, что нация уходит с исторической сцены, она уходит не только количественно, она уходит качественно. стр. 6-7</p>; <p>О качественном уходе нации позвольте привести пример.</p> <p>Клеточные потоки (и бактериальная его нагрузка) в человеческом организме за всю жизнь проходят большую длинную историю. В каждом из нас в течение жизни к 60 годам пройдет 1025 клеток. Это примерно вес двух с половиной слонов. Оказывается, пока внешняя среда была экзотоксичной, была только экологическая травма, клетки сохранялись, сохранялось среднее долгожительство. Теперь токсины проникли внутрь организма, в мозг и поражаются уже не только существующие клетки в почках, печени, но и те клетки, которые будут обепечивать вам в 50-60 лет потенцию органов. Это похоже на то, как здоровая девочка или женщина, которая прошла токсическую или радиационную зону. Соматически, казалось бы, она здорова, но родить не может, т. к. поражены яйцеклетки. Следовательно, идет коренное подтачивание не просто здоровья, а глубинного клеточного потенциала населения России. Это уже прочно доказано.</p> <p>Популяция - это поток, и поток очень сложный. На входе потока сегодня 28 млн. населения за Уралом, из них 50 % работоспособного. Плотность населения 0,8-1 человек на 1 км2. Чтобы обустроить территорию, где живет клан людей, оптимально необходимо 7-8 человек на 1 км2. Рядом в Китае 1 млрд. 200 млн. населения. Демографическое давление гигантское! Мы сейчас находимся в неустойчивой фазе, до 80 % беременных женщин больны, большое количество детей тоже больны, нового воспроизводства практически нет, а образование нового поколения идет по стабильной линии, которая приспосабливает население к выживанию в условиях рыночно-коммерческого мира. Следовательно, культура нации, ее наука, интеллектуальный потенциал сдвинулись опасно вниз. Прогнозируется увеличение процессов, влияющих на нестабильность нации, и резкое снижение защитных процессов (рис. 1). К 2050 г. в Зауралье мы будем иметь 24-25 млн. населения. Из них количество больных будет составлять 60%. Таким образом, число потенциально работоспособных сократится до 30% .</p> <p>7</p> <p>Уровень образования населения, снизится. До 70% населения будет иметь низшее или околосреднее образование. Это дешевая рабочая сила. В такой социально-естественной исторической ситуации не оказалась еще ни одна из слаборазвитых стран второго и третьего мира.</p> <p>Численность потока популяции падает, а синдром утомления населения сегодня с 60% возрастет к 2050 г. до 80%.</p> <p>стр 7-8</p>; <p>Таким образом, на пороге XXI века в евразийской части России образовался ранее неизвестный исторический, социальный, культурный, демографический феномен. Корни этого явления следует искать в нашей истории: строительство тоталитарного режима &nbsp;сопровождалось переистощением природы и переистощением народонаселения при эксплуатации этой природы. В конечном счете, тоталитарная система развалилась, развалилась в агрессивную сторону так, что это привело к снижению резерва народонаселения, ухудшению его биологического (репродуктивного), физиологического, психического здоровья, исчезновению социальной потребности в талантах, наклонностях каждого человека, потребности воспитать каждого ребенка в будущем талантливым социально-эффективным гражданином. В то же время проявляющиеся элементы нового варианта тоталитаризма (коррупция в государственных структурах, расчленение общества на богатых и бедных) имеют тенденцию привести к эксплуатации природы и человека в еще более худшем варианте, чем это происходило доселе в известных цивилизациях.</p> <p>И в организации государственности, в государственном управлении несомненно требуются новые, не только реформаторские, но и принципиально перспективные изменения. Поэтому проблема развития государственности и управления составляет сейчас важнейшую интегральную, междисциплинарную, межнаучную общность интересов населения евразийской части России. Эта общность интересов тесно связана с системой безопасности России. Безопасность же страны, в свою очередь, все больше упирается в вопросы новой геополитики, подчиняясь идее многополюсного развития различных цивилизаций на поверхности Земли.</p> <p>Вопросы государственного управления должны учитывать реальность так называемой &laquo;ловушки&raquo; современной исторической ниши, куда вовлекается евразийская часть России. &laquo;Ловушка&raquo; состоит в том, что на каждую единицу валового продукта на этих территориях тратится человеческого здоровья - человеко-часов здоровой жизни - примерно</p> <p>9</p> <p>&nbsp;в 20, а в некоторых производствах и в 50 раз больше, чем в развитых европейских странах. То есть на одну единицу продукта: нефти, газа и т. д. количество человеко-часов, подобно расходу горючего на единицу пробега, &laquo;выжигается&raquo; в 20-50 раз больше. Такое выжигание этого важнейшего государственного ресурса не учитывается в государственной статистике, в государственных органах власти. Быстро теряется человеческий капитал.</p> <p>стр. 9-10</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7VP8IGZG\Проблемы геополитики и выживания нации России в XXI веке.pdf","","анропоэкономика; выживание населения; здоровье; Казначеев","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Причём после своей основной работы людям приходилось ещё заниматься разгрузкой барж, строи- тельством жилья и т. д. Созданное в марте объединение не было учтено в планах по труду и финан- сированию, следовательно, все вопросы решались в течение года разовыми рас- поряжениями и постановлениями. Снаб- жение машинами, оборудованием и ма- териалами осуществлялось с большими перебоями и не в полном объёме. Строи- тельство приходилось вести практиче- ски одновременно с проектированием объектов. Схемы разработки месторождений на момент начала добычи ещё не были соз- даны, поэтому использовались схемы, составленные самими работниками про- мыслов. стр. 66-67</p>; <p>В следующем, 1965 г., план добычи для &laquo;Тюменнефтегаза&raquo; составил 700 тыс. т нефти. Но его превысили уже по итогам трёх кварталов &ndash; из недр извлекли 746,4 тыс. т сырья, себестоимость которого су- щественно снизилась. Завершалось строительство нефтепровода Шаим &ndash; Тю- мень, вступившего в строй 3 ноября 1965 г. Наращивался объём бурения, соз- давались системы сбора нефти. На двух месторождениях &ndash; Трёхозёрном и Меги- онском &ndash; проводилась пробная закачка воды для поддержания пластового давле- ния. Отрабатывались режимы и скоро- сти бурения, типы долот, глинистые рас- творы, осуществлялось цементирование эксплуатационных колонн. Началось бу- рение наклонно-направленных скважин кустовым способом. <span style=""background-color: #e4d81a;"">Однако сложно об- стояли дела с бурением на газ, возросла аварийность, планы не выполнялись. Рос коллектив нефтяников: если на на- чало 1965 г.</span> численность рабочих состав- ляла 5380, то к концу года она уже пре- высила 9600 человек. В два раза увели- чился штат ИТР. Создавались учебно-курсовые комби- наты, за год их было открыто 4. Большие трудности имелись в сфере жилищного строительства, сооружения социальных объектов.

Ранее данная контора часто оказывалась в центре внимания ру- ководства, принимались меры, менялись начальники. За 5 месяцев их сменилось 5. После произошедшего Слепян принял незамедлительные меры: кого-то уволи- ли, некоторые получили строгие выгово- ры (в том числе управляющий конторой и его заместитель, которые приступили к исполнению обязанностей за две недели до трагедии).

In an Internet society, according to Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers, accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. In an era when machines can out-perform human beings at most tasks, what are the prospects for employment, who should own and control online expertise, and what tasks should be reserved exclusively for people?  About the book The Future of the Professions explains how 'increasingly capable systems' - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will bring fundamental change in the way that the 'practical expertise' of specialists is made available in society.  The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's professionals. They argue that our current professions are antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the expertise of the best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place, they propose six new models for producing and distributing expertise in society.  The book raises important practical and moral questions. In an era when machines can out-perform human beings at most tasks, what are the prospects for employment, who should own and control online expertise, and what tasks should be reserved exclusively for people?  Based on the authors' in-depth research of more than ten professions, and illustrated by numerous examples from each, this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of the professions in the 21st century. About the Authors Professor Richard Susskind OBE is an author, speaker, and independent adviser to international professional firms and national governments. He is President of the Society for Computers and Law, IT Adviser to the Lord Chief Justice of England, and Chair of the Advisory Board of the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. His numerous books include the best-sellers, The End of Lawyers? (OUP, 2008) and Tomorrow's Lawyers (OUP, 2013), his work has been translated into more than 10 languages, and he has been invited to speak in over 40 countries. Daniel Susskind is a Lecturer in Economics at Balliol College, Oxford, where he teaches and researches, and from where he has two degrees in economics. Previously, he worked for the British Government - in the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit, in the Policy Unit in 10 Downing Street, and as a Senior Policy Adviser at the Cabinet Office. He was a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard University.

Условия труда в данном секторе связаны с применением пестицидов, ядохимикатов, контактом с животными, пылью и др. (Водяненко И.М, 2000; Baum F, 2005; Евсюков А.А. 2010). Социальные и экономические условия жизни сельских жителей, хуже, чем в городах. Нередко труднодоступные населенные пункты разобщены. Районы территориально протяженны. Низкая плотность населения. Неудовлетворительно дорожно-транспортное сообщение между населенными пунктами. Специфика условий сельскохозяйственного труда и быта на селе накладывают дополнительные сложности в процессе оказания медицинской помощи населению сельских муниципальных образований (Филатов В.Б., 1993; Сыров В.А. с соавт., 1998; Лакунин К.Ю., 2001; Михайлова Ю.В., Магнитский В.А., 2002; Растегаев В.В., 2005; Суслин С.А., 2005). Целый ряд исследователей Р.Г. Оганов, Г.В. Погосова (2004), Д.А. Скулаков (2004), Н.Ф. Измеров с соавт. (2005), С.А. Арасланова (2006) отмечали неблагоприятные медико-демографические тенденции в различных регионах страны, во многом характеризующиеся схожими чертами: отмечается сокращение численности жителей села, низкая рождаемость и высокая смертность, обусловливающие существенную естественную убыль населения.  На селе особо выражены гендерные различия смертности: отмечается более высокий уровень смертности мужчин в трудоспособном возрасте, который превышает таковой у женщин почти в четыре раза. На первом месте, среди причин смерти в сельской местности, болезни системы кровообращения, на втором – несчастные случаи, отравления и травмы, на третьем – новообразования (Гизатуллин И.Ф., 2006). Анализ демографической структуры сельского населения показал следующее: дети в возрасте до 15 лет в структуре всего населения составляют 18,1 %, подростки (15-17) – 8,9 %, население в трудоспособном возрасте – 52,8 %, лица пенсионного возраста – 20,2 %. На селе велика доля наиболее затратных, по оказанию медицинской помощи, групп населения: дети и лица пенсионного возраста. Особенностью демографической ситуации на селе является постарение населения. Уменьшение рождаемости и увеличение миграции трудоспособного населения вместе с детьми из сельской местности в города способствует повышению доли лиц пожилого возраста проживающих в селах (Максимова Т.М. и др., 2011; Гехт И.А., 2002). Из общего числа умерших на долю мужчин приходиться 54 % (Комаров Ю.М., 2007). Некоторые авторы, анализируя демографическую ситуацию в сельской местности, говорят о вымирании деревни. До пенсии по старости и до более старших возрастов сельские мужчины доживают только в 13 регионах Российской Федерации, главным образом, в южных республиках (Рогожников В.А., Стародубов В.И., Орлова Г.Г., 2004). Маргинальный тип смертности (преимущественно мужчин в трудоспособном возрасте) усилит тенденцию формирования практически однополого женского населения. Женский перевес в наиболее активных возрастах (20-59 лет) может достичь соотношения 1148 женщин на 1000 мужчин (Герасименко Н.Ф., 2009). Несмотря на то, что численность женщин в селе превышает численность мужчин на 10 %, потери мужчин превышают женские почти в 4 раза. Особенно выражен этот дисбаланс в молодых трудоспособных возрастах (29-30 лет), где на долю женщин приходилось 19 %, а на долю мужчин – 81 % потерь (Рогожников В.А., 2003; Какорина Е.П. и др., 2010).","2012","2016-04-27 08:46:34","2016-04-27 10:05:03","2016-04-08 09:34:20","","","","","","","","","","","","Russian Academy of Natural History","","","","","","","","","","<blockquote cite=""http://www.monographies.ru/ru/book/view?id=182""> <p>Название издания: ПРОБЛЕМЫ ЗДРАВООХРАНЕНИЯ СЕЛА <br /> <br />Автор: Стародубов В И, Калининская А А, Дзугаев К Г, Стрючков В В <br /> <br />Издательство: Академия Естествознания <br /> <br />Год издания: 2012 <br /> <br />ISBN: 978-5-91327-193-8</p> </blockquote>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JBU9PX2F\view.html","","здоровье населения; медицинский сервис; Сельское здравоохранение","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parental informed consent process in a rural setting of northern Ghana was studied to describe comprehension and retention among parents as part of the evaluation of the existing informed consent process. METHODS: The study involved 270 female parents who gave consent for their children to participate in a prospective cohort study that evaluated immune correlates of protection against childhood malaria in northern Ghana. A semi-structured interview with questions based on the informed consent themes was administered. Parents were interviewed on their comprehension and retention of the process and also on ways to improve upon the existing process. RESULTS: The average parental age was 33.3 years (range 18-62), married women constituted a majority (91.9%), Christians (71.9%), farmers (62.2%) and those with no formal education (53.7%). Only 3% had ever taken part in a research and 54% had at least one relation ever participate in a research. About 90% of parents knew their children were involved in a research study that was not related to medical care, and 66% said the study procedures were thoroughly explained to them. Approximately, 70% recalled the study involved direct benefits compared with 20% for direct risks. The majority (95%) understood study participation was completely voluntary but only 21% recalled they could withdraw from the study without giving reasons. Younger parents had more consistent comprehension than older ones. Maternal reasons for allowing their children to take part in the research were free medical care (36.5%), better medical care (18.8%), general benefits (29.4%), contribution to research in the area (8.8%) and benefit to the community (1.8%). Parental suggestions for improving the consent process included devoting more time for explanations (46.9%), use of the local languages (15.9%) and obtaining consent at home (10.3%). CONCLUSION: Significant but varied comprehension of the informed consent process exists among parents who participate in research activities in northern Ghana and it appears the existing practices are fairly effective in informing research participants in the study area.","2008-06-19","2016-04-27 08:55:44","2016-04-27 08:55:44","","12-12","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Web of Science","","MEDLINE:18565230","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She was at a nutritional research center which provided basic medical services. In addition to visiting mothers in their homes to talk about health education, such as oral rehydration and advice on hand washing, she would also encourage them to bring their children to the infant welfare clinic for immunizations. She told the mothers that the health staff would check the growth and nutritional status of their children and why these activities were important. Staff at the clinic aimed to see all the children 2 years 9 times the 1st year and 4 times the 2nd year. All anthropometric data were forwarded to Cambridge, England to be included in a continuing study on the growth of the population. The clinic referred children with serious illnesses to the pediatrician or, if necessary, took them to a hospital on the coast. Children that came to the clinic with a fever 37.4 degrees Celsius during the wet season had a blood film taken to check for malaria parasites. Indeed cerebral malaria contributed greatly to child deaths in the Gambia. If malaria was present, children received their 1st dose of chloroquine immediately so the staff could determine tolerance. 3 doses followed this dose. The health visitor also organized the health education component of the clinic. The clinic dresser interpreted the British nurse's presentations to eventually conduct them alone. The nurse divided the mothers and fathers into 2 groups. In the future, she would evaluate the 2 groups to determine if weekly education on hand washing and skin hygiene would reduce diarrheal and cutaneous disease incidence in children 3 years old. The other group learned about family planning. Both groups learned about immunization, detection of illness, safety, sanitation, nutritional advice, dental care, and food preparation.","1991-01","2016-04-27 08:55:44","2016-04-27 08:55:44","","19-20","","1","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Web of Science","","MEDLINE:1993601","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"R55W8F9C","book","2011","MacDonald, Scott B.; Novo, Andrew","When Small Countries Crash","","978-1-4128-4398-0","","","","The public is fascinated with financial crashes. Historians portray the roar of an angry mob toppling presidents or prime ministers and destroying the property of those who are regarded as malefactors. And certainly, financial crisis is often a factor in political change. It is often overlooked, but nonetheless significant that one of the major causes for the French Revolution was the poor state of finances, with the nation coming to bankruptcy. Large systemic financial crises create history. Various actors, big and small, become caught in the drama, contributing to it in their own special way. When Small Countries Crash seeks to capture some of the drama of financial collapses and their impact on small countries, which the authors define as populations under 10 million, generally 5-6 million. MacDonald and Novo have selected countries that have had a financial crisis in the national economy; that included key actors; and where access to reliable data is available. As the authors demonstrate, the story of small countries suffering the costs of financial missteps is long and painful. They argue that smaller economies tend to be more vulnerable to economic shocks, many of which are externally generated. Small economies confront particular challenges in terms of economies of scale, diversification, and depth of expertise and workforce. The chapters in this absorbing book focus on Iceland, Latvia, Ireland, the Caribbean, Scotland, Finland, and Albania. This in-depth study is unique in its close look at financial disasters in countries that have, until now, been overlooked.","2011-12-31","2016-04-25 05:39:49","2016-04-25 05:39:49","","","225","","","","","","","","","","Transaction Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=1Ro2fQotinsC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Business & Economics / Economics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Интересно, сам по себе он не выглядит особо выдающимся исследователем, а на него столько ссылаются...</p> <p>Отмечается, что один из способов осмысления последних изменений основывается на конвергенции между европейскими и британскими способами организации профессиональной работы.</p> <p> - <em>Первое разделение конт. и сакс. моделей проф.:</em> In 1990 Collins was able to distinguish ‘Anglo-Saxon’ and ‘Continental’ modes of professionalism (Collins, 1990: 98)</p> <p>Burrage and Torstendahl (1990) identified four key ‘actors’ in the development of professions – practitioners, users, states and universities Теперь + 5-й элемент: нанимающая организация.</p> <p>Другой подход к интерпретации профессионализма - рассматривать не столько статус конкретного рода деятельности, но больше сфокусироваться на дискурсе профессионализма. Иветтс называет это новым или организационным профессионализмом.</p> <p>Accounts of change describe a shift from notions of partnership, collegiality, discretion and trust to increasing levels of managerialism, bureaucracy, standardization, assessment and performance review.</p> <p>End of the third logic: professionalism is now organizationally defined</p> <p>this discourse is increasingly applied and utilized by managers.</p> <p>Очень полезный для анализа краудсорсинга подход McClelland’s (1990: 107) на профессионализацию изнутри (проф. сами развиваются, определяют правильный свособ выполнения работ и др.) и снаружи. То есть, классические профессии - это те, кто раньше других сумел установить эту практику самопрофессионализации. Это позволяет добиваться повышения своего статуса и, возможно, является позитивным фактором для общества в целом.</p> <p>Когда дискурс проф. приходит ""сверху"", он используется в качестве идеологии для интерн. контроля. О том, как это было принято во многих новообр. профессиях, см. Muzio. В результате, контроль над выполнением работы переходит к менеджерам, происходит рационализация. Ориентиром для развития становится наилучшее удовлетворение требований клиента при сокращении времени и оплаты. При таком варианте развития событий не остается места для проф. контроля за соответствием работы ст. качества и для этики. Эти тенденции распр. в Англии в образоват. учреждениях и в primary care.</p> <p>Один из способов интерпр. этих изменений - через категории депрофессионализации и пролетаризации. (Reed, 2007). (Evetts, 2009a, 2009b)</p> <p>Можно рассматривать оборонительные практики проф.: (see articles by Muzio et al. and Kirkpatrick et al., this issue; see also Abel, 2003; Muzio and Ackroyd, 2005; Reed, 2007).</p> <p>Но важнее всего включать в анализ <em>стратегии и тактики, которые задействуют профессионалы в этой непростой ситуации.</em></p> <p> <strong>История - профессионализм, как маркер высокого статуса рода деятельности</strong><strong></strong>In early analyses of professions, in both Britain and the US, the key concept was the occupational value of ‘professionalism’ and its importance for the stability and civility of social systems (e.g. Carr-Saunders and Wilson, 1933; Marshall, 1950; Tawney, 1921).</p> <p><strong>Очень точная и содержательная рецепция Парсонса:</strong><strong></strong>(1939). Parsons recognized and was one of the first theorists to show how the capitalist economy, the rational-legal social order (of Weber) and the modern professions were all interrelated and mutually balancing in the maintenance and stability of a fragile normative social order. He demonstrated how the authority of the professions and of bureaucratic hierarchical organizations both rested on the same principles (for example of functional specificity, restriction of the power domain, application of universalistic, impersonal standards). The professions, however, by means of their collegial organization and shared identity, demonstrated an alternative approach (compared with the managerial hierarchy of bureaucratic organizations) towards the shared normative end.</p> <p>После Нео-веберианской критики функционалистского подхода к профессиям Парсонса, The differences between professionalism and rational-legal, bureaucratic, hierarchical ways of organizing work have been returned to, however, in Freidson’s (2001) recent analysis</p> <p>According to Freidson, ‘the ideal typical position of professionalism is founded on the official belief that the knowledge and skill of a particular specialization requires a foundation in abstract concepts and formal learning’ (2001: 34–5).</p> <p>Нео-веб. критика: Джонсон, Лаккин, Эббот (А.Ю. читал, просмотреть тоже), Сакс.</p> <p><strong>A third and later development</strong> involved the analysis of professionalism as a discourse of occupational change and control – this time primarily within organizational contexts where this discourse is increasingly applied and utilized by managers.</p> <p>Anderson-Gough et al. (1998) - развитие дискурса профессионализма как средство контроля работников бухгалтерских фирм. Fournier (1999) - призыв к проф., как дисциплинарный механизм в новых видах деятельности (специальностях) - Определиться с терминами!!!</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Говорит о том, что призыв к профессионализму объясняется тем, что это слово сохраняет позитивные коннотации с идеализированным представлением о классических профессиях.</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Еще раз, идеальный тип профессии - Aspects include:<br /></span></strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">• Control of the work systems, processes, procedures, priorities to be determined primarily by the practitioner/s;</span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><br />• Professional institutions/associations as the main providers of codes of ethics, constructors of the discourse of professionalism, providers of licensing and admission procedures, controllers of competences and their acquisition and maintenance, overseeing discipline, due investigation of complaints and appropriate sanctions in cases of professional incompetence;<br />• Collegial authority, legitimacy, mutual support and cooperation;<br />• Common and lengthy (perhaps expensive) periods of shared education, training, apprenticeship;<br />• Development of strong occupational identities and work cultures;<br />• Strong sense of purpose and of the importance, function, contribution and significance of the work;<br />• Discretionary judgement, assessment evaluation and decision-making, often in highly complex cases, and of confidential advice-giving, treatment and alternative ways of proceeding;<br />• Trust and confidence characterizing the relations between practitioner/client, practitioner/employer and fellow practitioners.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Но важно понимать, что это - не средства операционализации, скорее these are aspects of the image and the ideology of professionalism</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">A new professionalism? Changes and continuities</span></strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Здесь необходимо проанализировать, допустимо ли все еще рассматривать профессионализм в качестве маркера высокого социального статуса.<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Aspects of change certainly include elements of hierarchy, bureaucracy, output and performance measures and even the standardization of work practices, all of which are more characteristic of organizational rather than professional forms of occupational control.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">When service sector professionals have proved enduringly difficult to manage and resistant to change, then an important part of the strategy became to recreate professionals as managers and to manage by normative techniques (see Noordegraaf</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Контроль формальных показателей работы профессионала становится важной частью любого проекта профессионализации. It is necessary to recognize, however, that output and performance measures also represent a ‘<span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">discourse of competition’ (Hoggett, 1996: 15) or what <span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">Broadbent et al. (1999)</span> termed ‘individualization’.</span></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">The danger is that social cohesion and institutional action are undermined while competition threatens both team working and collegial support. Thus, the quest for professionalism and accountability is highly competitive and individualistic, but it is also a bureaucratic means of regaining and exercising control over a market-directed enterprise staffed by professionals.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">New Public Services Management] in the UK imposes The emphasis on governance and community controls, the negotiations between complex numbers of agencies and interests and the recreation of professionals themselves as managers (see Mueller et al., this issue)<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">control is increasingly achieved by means of normative values and self-regulated motivation. In professional services firms a discourse of enterprise is fitted alongside the language of quality and customer care and the ideologies of empowerment, innovation, autonomy and discretion. In addition, this is also a discourse of individualization and competition where individual performance is linked to the success or failure of the organization. These all constitute powerful mechanisms of worker/employee control in which the occupational values of professionalism are used to promote the efficient management of the organization.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">In numerous ways, centralizing, regulatory governments, intent on demonstrating value from public service budgets, seem to be redefining professionalism and accountability as measurable. - <em>В принципе, есть все основания говорить о том, что профессия как вид деятельности повышенного статуса уже не существует. </em><br /></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Оговорки - аспекты, в которых все по-старому:</span></strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">More market pressures often lead to more community-based practices such as multidisciplinary teams and cooperative working which are consistent with occupational forms of professionalism.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Некоторые професси вполне могут называться таковыми в классическом смысле (юристы, меньше врачи). Сами организации предоставляют отличную площадку для профессионализации некоторых специальностей (международная отчетность, управление персоналом)</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">national institutions and European professional federations принимают новые вызовы, развивают performance criteria, target setting and continuing professional development (CPD). Тем самым они сохраняют внутренний контроль над деятельностью профессионалов.<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">In addition, there are also examples of the sharing, modification and adaptation of particular regulatory regimes between different professional institutions and federations (Evetts, 1994; see also Flood, this issue).</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Дискуссия</span></strong></p> <p><strong></strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Последствия и вызовы для профессий, связанные с современным развитием, широко представлены в литературе: (e.g. Bolton, 2005; Bourgeault and Benoit, 2009; Boussard, 2006; Champy, 2008; Dent et al., 2008; Schepers, 2006; Wrede, 2008) and research links with sociologists of organizations are developing (Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2008).<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">В случае с некоторыми устоявшимися профессиями (врачи, сотрудники университетов) влияние современных тенденций ограничено, поскольку здесь достаточно сложно формализовать оценку результатов профессиональной работы. Таким образом, сложно подчинить такой вид деятельности рыночной или организационной логике. Но все же некоторое влияние есть - в первую очередь, через попытки формализовать результаты работы (в т.ч. палочная система у полицейских)</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">The commodification of professional service work entails changes in professional work relations. When practitioners become organizational employees then the traditional relationship of employer–professional trust is changed to one necessitating supervision, assessment and audit. Relationships between professionals and clients are also being converted into customer relations through the establishment of quasi-markets, customer satisfaction surveys and evaluations as well as quality measures and payment by results.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Clients are converted into customers and professional work competencies become primarily related to, defined and assessed by the work organization.</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Открывающиеся возможности</span></strong></p> <p><strong></strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Одним из эффектов объединения логик является развитие эйчэр отделов и компаний. Они также способствуют тому, что учитываютсмя ИНДИВИДУАЛЬНЫЕ достоинства и недостатки профессионала. Indeed, human resources procedures have contributed to the spectacular growth in professional employment over the last 20 years and have improved diversity and equal opportunities.<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Standardization and formalization of selection, retention and career development procedures have also <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">increased the transparency</span> of what were often hidden, even ‘mysterious’ <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">arrangements in respect of promotion, career progress</span> and departmental relationships and links within the organization.</span></p> <p>На микроуровне, некоторые профессионалы приобретают менеджерские компетенции.</p> <p>In addition, and as Muzio and Kirkpatrick explain in the Introduction to this collection, organizations can constitute sites for (and objects of) professional control and domination. - то есть что, происходит постоянно борьба за то, кто будет выполнять ту или иную работу? Очень подходит для описания отношений между МТ, краудами и проф. переводчиками.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HPT87NT4\evetts2003.pdf","","оп1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Для создания масштабируемых, высококачественных и гладких переводов, с которыми ни «ручной», ни машинный перевод конкурировать не могут, САП сочетает эффективные техники обработки данных с качеством и процессом человеческой работы.<!--EndFragment--></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Преимущество энтузиастов-экспертов по сравнению с проф. переводчиками:</span><!--StartFragment-->Еще лучше краудсорсинг сработал для корпорации Mozilla, чей браузер Firefox полностью доступен на 70 языках. Как и в случае с Dreamweaver, сообщество переводчиков Mozilla Firefox — это заядлые технари-энтузиасты, владеющие нужными терминами на своем языке и способные назвать новые возможности новыми подходящими словами.<!--EndFragment--></p> <p><!--StartFragment-->Как показали оба случая, в определенной ситуации перевод энтузиастов может быть технически более точным, чем перевод профессиональный. Но при этом не учитывается, что не всякий опытный пользователь подбирает слова с таким же усердием, с каким каждый профессиональный переводчик вникает в техническую «матчасть».<!--EndFragment--></p> <p><!--StartFragment--></p> <h4>Расходы постфактум</h4> <p><br /> В случае с краудсорсингом, подходить к переводу должным образом, заботясь о его качестве и грамотном расходовании средств, — задача не из простых. Кинуть клич на краудсорсинговой платформе не значит получить перевод на блюдечке с голубой каёмочкой. Ведь чтобы оценить полученные результаты, исправить ошибки в коде или форматировании, владельцу оригинального текста нужны специальные инструменты. <br /> <br /> Вдобавок к этому, заказчику перевода нужны компетенции в области управления проектами, о чём забывают даже крупные компании. Это как вместо поддержки штатного отдела маркетинга управлять разрозненными помощниками, каждый из которых отвечает только за свою часть дела. А поскольку вы платите по тарифам краудсорсинга (мало или ничего), ваши помощники скорее всего не согласятся выполнять очень большой объем работы. В свою очередь, это вызывает потребность в увеличении числа помощников — и еще больше усложняет менеджмент. <br /> <br /> Вероятно, не все переводы будут хороши. Переводы низкого качества добавляют хлопот экспертам, вычитывающим текст, и убивают их энтузиазм (за исключением, вероятно, фанатичных сообществ — таких, как костяк разработчиков Linux). Так как в хорошо организованных аутсорсинговых процессах экспертная вычитка происходит достаточно рано, не выгорят ли эксперты к финальному этапу работы? Задумайтесь о тех, кто будет переводить текст, и о накладных расходах на управление коллективной активностью: стоит ли со всем этим связываться?<!--EndFragment--></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><!--StartFragment-->При ближайшем рассмотрении потенциальные преимущества краудсорсинга — качество, низкая стоимость, скорость получения результата — могут оказаться обманчивыми.<br /> <br /> Во многих случаях сообщества должны работать вместе с профессиональными переводчиками для подготовки качественного, масштабируемого перевода и управления процессом.<em>Каждый из тысяч переводчиков в краудсорсинг-проекте использует свой «словарь». В результате один и тот же термин будет переведен по разному, что вряд ли упростит жизнь пользователям программы.</em><!--EndFragment--></p>","","","блог; оп1; краудсорсинг","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today they operate in and for an ever more technologized society, within a complex, competitive system of client and user expectations, tools, and new forms of organization and work conditions. This article explores the main industry-level, technological and social developments that have forced many translators to further resituate their practice as co-constructors of knowledge and co-communicators in today’s media landscape. It argues that despite the challenges of powerful automatic implementation and the upsurge of volunteer crowdsourcers, professional translators will continue to adapt to evolving work conditions and emerging phenomena, moving the traditional boundaries of the practice and discipline of translation.</p>; <p>Библиография</p> <ol> <li>Aranberri, N., Labaka, G., Díaz de Ilarraza, A., &amp; Sarasola, K.

However, these provide no insight into possible errors, and do not scale well with sentence length. We argue for a semantics-based evaluation, which captures what meaning components are retained in the MT output, thus providing a more fine-grained analysis of translation quality, and enabling the construction and tuning of semantics-based MT. We present a novel human semantic evaluation measure, Human UCCA-based MT Evaluation (HUME), building on the UCCA semantic representation scheme. HUME covers a wider range of semantic phenomena than previous methods and does not rely on semantic annotation of the potentially garbled MT output. We experiment with four language pairs, demonstrating HUME's broad applicability, and report good inter-annotator agreement rates and correlation with human adequacy scores.","","2016-09-29 10:25:34","2016-09-29 10:27:04","2016-09-29 10:25:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\K2R8NFME\1607.00030v2.pdf","","MT evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article analyses the everyday communicative practices of adults living in Sydney surrounding their use of text messaging in shared social spaces. Asking the research participants when, how and why they rely on text messaging exposes increasingly routine transgressions of boundaries between different social spheres. While participants were acutely aware of largely unspoken social norms and expectations attached to mobile phone use in the presence of others, they themselves strategically used text messages to create layers of intimacy within shared social spaces. We explore the implications of this tension by highlighting how rituals of social interaction are cared about by social actors but play into a wider sense of the abandonment of care for the presence of others.","2015-07-01","2016-09-27 05:39:23","2016-09-27 05:39:23","2016-09-27 05:39:23","703-719","","5","37","","Media Culture Society","‘People just don’t care’","","","","","","","en","","","","","mcs.sagepub.com","","","","","","","care; civil inattention; everyday media practices; mediated communication; mobile phone use; social interaction; text messaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike a traditional payphone in public, cellphones do not have privacy booths. Therefore, the ways in which people respond to cellphone calls in public spaces provide markers for social topographical space. In this study I explore how cellphone users negotiate privacy when using cellphones in public space and how those within the proximity of the caller negotiate space in response to these callers. Based on a year-long study involving observation fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I discuss the flexibility with which people constantly negotiate their private and public sense of self when using and responding to cellphones in public spaces.","2005-10-01","2016-09-27 05:37:28","2016-09-27 05:37:28","2016-09-27 05:37:28","367-384","","4","35","","Journal of Technical Writing and Communication","Social Topography in a Wireless Era","","","","","","","en","","","","","jtw.sagepub.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eliot Freidson formalizes professionalism by treating it as an ideal type grounded in the political economy; he presents the concept as a third logic, or a more viable alternative to consumerism and bureaucracy. He asks us to imagine a world where workers with specialized knowledge and the ability to provide society with especially important services can organize and control their own work, without directives from management or the influence of free markets.Freidson then appraises the present status of professionalism, exploring how traditional and national variations in state policy and organization are influencing the power and practice of such professions as medicine and law. Widespread attacks by neoclassical economists and populists, he contends, are obscuring the social value of credentialism and monopolies. The institutions that sustain professionalism in our world are simply too useful to both capital and state to dismiss.","","2016-09-23 07:17:08","2016-09-23 07:18:21","2016-09-23 07:17:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","press.uchicago.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dale turned an avocation into a vocation; a vocation of helping people in the mountains. Dale trains rescuers around the world and has published and presented numerous technical papers and general articles on a diverse range of topics from avalanches, mountain rescue, human factors, risk, to decision-making. Professionally, Dale works for the Swedish rescue company RECCO AB. While he still volunteers with ART, he is also the president of the American Avalanche Association and the vice president of the Avalanche Rescue Commission of the International Commission for Alpine Rescue.

The example of the Antiques Roadshow<br />is used to explore a strategy for ethnographic attention to the diversity of mundane<br />engagements with a particular television text via the internet. The development of<br />this strategy draws on recent thinking on the constitution of ethnographic field sites,<br />focusing on conceptualization of the field as a made object, and development of multisited<br />approaches as appropriate forms of engagement with contemporary culture.<br />This strategy also builds on recent debates about the significance of ‘found’ digital data<br />for social research. Potential problems with this approach include loss of depth and<br />contextualizing information, and the risk of only focusing on that data which is easily<br />found by dominant search engines. These problems can be offset to some extent by<br />increased focus on reflexivity, and by allowing the field site to spill out beyond the<br />internet as the ethnographer finds it necessary and useful in order to explore particular<br />practices of meaning-making.</p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p>As a phenomenon which makes interactions of diverse kinds persistent, traceable and amenable to sociological gaze (Beer and Burrows, 2007; Savage and Burrows, 2007), the internet provides a rich resource for studying the way that people engage with media.</p> <p>The approach developed here is a mobile ethnography of media engagement across diverse sites, making use of ready-to-hand internet search engines to identify locations and connections. Such an approach is inevitably selective, and it will have shortcomings in depth, as compared to intensive study of a bounded location. It could, however, prove a revealing resource for theoretically driven reflections on the role of media texts as cultural resources, and the diverse yet patterned modes of engagement with media texts.</p> <p>Quite early in the development of the mainstream internet it became clear that discussion groups focused on television shows offered a new way to participate in fandom. These online studies often focus on a single interpretive community, but can also usefully move between groups to demonstrate the very situated nature of these interpretations</p> <p>Studies of online fandom can, however, be somewhat frustrating in how little they can tell us about the people who take part and the way that group participation fits into other aspects of their lives, and also just how distinctive this particular way of engaging with television might be.</p> <p>Но ограничение сообществами фанатов ведет ко всяческим искажениям. Надо рассматривать и другие интернет-источники, более казуальные и менее сфокусированные на конкретном предмете.</p> <p>Есть много исследований, в которых используется метод невключенного наблюдения для изучения поведения людей в том, что касается их взаимодействия с медиа и повседневных разговоров.</p> <p>Such unobtrusive methods offer a way to find out what people say about the media when they are not consciously ‘talking about the media’, as they are when a media studies researcher interviews them. ‘Hanging out’ in some form or other is often a part of the ethnographic experience, although it has possibly been under-used in media studies research.</p> <p>It is my goal, in this paper, to develop an online version of ‘hanging out’ in order to pursue Radway’s aspiration and complement in-depth studies of online fandom.</p> <p>The sheer quantity of user-generated content now available on the internet, and the possibility of searching for relevant remarks and unobtrusively lurking in the places where they are generated, offers a renewed possibility for media studies researchers to ‘hang out’ where people are and capture some of the ways that they engage with media.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Еще несколько примеров, что этнографические исследования носят... бихевиористский, что ли, характер:</span></p> <p>boyd (2008) deploys a combination of online and offline, directive and unobtrusive methods to flesh out her ethnographic exploration of what the use of social networking sites means in the lives of teenagers</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Статичное или мобильное этнографичческое исследование</span></p> <p>The internet encourages us to move away from a model of ethnography focused on intensive engagement within a single site, towards a more fluid, mobile and connective form of fieldwork. This move is in line with a strand of recent developments in anthropology which stress the strength of mobile and multi-sited approaches for engaging with the complexity of contemporary life (Marcus, 1995, 1998)</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Задача конкретного исследования:</span></p> <p>I will develop an example that traces a single media text through diverse mediating technologies and locations, making use of a variety of ready-to-hand tools such as the internet search engine to locate relevant connections and explore some of the meaning-making practices that unfold in diverse settings.</p> <p>This discussion is not, in itself, an ethnography. The exploration is ethnographic, however, in that it aspires to understand cultural practices in their own right, accepting that they make sense for the people engaged within them. The ethnographic spirit of enquiry focuses on exploring how practices are made meaningful, without assuming in advance what the appropriate structures of meaning-making might be.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FAVC7SMC\10.1177@0163443711401940.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coding means that we attach labels to segments of data that depict what each segment is about.</span></p> <p>Our work cuhninates in a 'grounded theory,' or an<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> abstract theoretical understanding of the studied experience.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">In short, grounded theory methods demystify the conduct of qualitative inquiry</span>-and expedite your research and enhance your excitement about it</p> <p>Glaser and Strauss's book The Discovery of Grounded Theory (1967) first articulated these strategies and advocated developing theories from research grounded in data rather than deducing testable hypotheses from existing theories.</p> <p>Значит, в 50-60-е года превалировали количественные исследования, основанные на дедукции из больших теорий. Ученые избегали тем, которые исключали количественные методы, поскольк в противном случае потеряли бы имидж научности. Росла пропасть между теоретиками и практиками. Практики исходили из больших теорий, и даже подправляли их, еслирезультаты исследования сильно не соответствовали. Но исследования редко выливались в новые теории.</p> <p>Essentially, Glaser and Strauss joined epistemological critique with practical guidelines for action. They proposed that systematic qualitative analysis had its own logic and could generate theory.</p> <p>For Glaser and Strauss (1967; Glaser, 1978; Strauss, 1987), the <strong>defining components of grounded theory </strong>practice include:</p> <p>• Simultaneous involvement in data collection and analysis</p> <p>•Constructing analytic codes and categories from data, not from preconceived logically deduced hypotheses</p> <p>• Using the constant comparative method, which involves making comparisons during each stage of the analysis</p> <p>&nbsp;• Advancing theory development during each step of data collection and analysis</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">• Memo-writing to elaborate categories, specify their properties, define relationships between categories, and identify gaps</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">• Sampling aimed toward theory construction, not for population representativeness</span></p> <p>• Conducting the literature review after developing an independent analysis.</p> <p>a completed grounded theory met the following criteria: a close fit with the data, usefulness, conceptual density, durability over time, modifiability, and explanatory power (Glaser, 1978, 1992; Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967).</p> <p><strong>По поводу объективизма авторов граунд-теории и конструктивизма Кармаз:</strong></p> <p>Throughout the book, I build on my earlier discussions of the grounded theory method (see esp. Charmaz, 1990, 2000, 2002a, 2003, 2005) and on a symbolic interactionist theoretical perspective. Grounded theory serves as a way to learn about the worlds we study and a method for developing theories to understand them.<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> In the classic grounded theory works, Glaser and Strauss talk about discovering theory as emerging from data separate from the scientific observer. Unlike their position, I assume that neither data nor theories are discovered. Rather, we are part of the world we study and the data we collect.</span> We C011Struct our grounded theories through our past and present involvements and interactions with people, perspectives, and research practices.</p> <p>Очень важно понимать, что построение граунд-теории – процесс не линейный.</p> <p><strong>Внимание! </strong>Очевидно, существуют проверенные способы, как вычленить смысл из выработанных в ходе исследования категорий. С ними необходимо ознакомиться потому, что идея кор.анализа писями по воде виляна:</p> <p>'Theoretical Sampling, Saturation, and Sorting,' explains theoretical sampling, the grounded theory strategy of obtaining further selective data to refine and fill out your major categories. In this chapter, I also question the meaning of<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> theoretical saturation as indicating that no new properties of the category emerge during data collection.</span> I next discuss sorting memos to fit the theoretical categories and show relationships that integrate the work. I introduce diagramming because increasing numbers of grounded theorists use it as an alternative way to integrate their ideas and to establish the logic of their ordering.</p> <p><strong>GATHERING RICH DATA chapter 2</strong></p> <p><strong>Критерии</strong><strong> богатых</strong><strong> данных</strong><strong>:</strong></p> <p>Rich data are detailed, focused, and full. They reveal participants' views, feelings, intentions, and actions as well as the contexts and structures of their lives.</p> <p>В рамках одного исследования допустимо использовать различные виды данных</p> <p>В первую очередь, мы пытаемся использовать данные для того, чтобы, насколько это возможно, взглянуть на ситуацию глазами тех, кого мы изучаем.</p> <p><em>Важнейшее</em><em> преимущество</em><em> кач</em><em>. Исследований</em><em>:</em></p> <p>Qualitative researchers have one great advantage over our quantitative colleagues. We can add new pieces to the research puzzle or conjure entire new puzzles-while we gather data-and that can even occur late in the analysis.</p> <p>Ну а граунд-теория позволяет сохранить эту гибкость, улучшая при этом фокусировку. Граунд-теория задает общее направление, но делает это достаточно гибко, чтобы не сковывать работу воображения.</p> <p>При этом, отмечается вторичность методологии, по сравнению с качествами исследователя (открытость мышления, наблюдательность – все такое)</p> <p><em>Еще</em><em> раз</em><em> о</em><em> конструктивизме</em><em>:</em></p> <p>Just as the methods we choose influence what we see, what we bring to the study also influences what we can see. Qualitative research of all sorts relies on those who conduct it. We are not passive receptacles into which data are poured.</p> <p>И именно признание этого факта, и рефлексия над ним вменяются в обязанность ученому, который использует качественные методы.</p> <p>The logic of grounded theory guides your methods of data-gathering as well as of theoretical development.</p> <p><em>Еще</em><em> пригрошня</em><em> социального</em><em> конструктивизма</em><em>:</em></p> <p>We may treat such documents, records, and census data as facts; however, individuals constructed them. Whatever stands as data flows from some purpose to realize a particular objective. In turn, purposes and objectives arise under particular historical, social, and situational conditions.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Grounded theorists often begin their studies with certain guiding empirical interests to study and, consistent with Blumer, general concepts that give a loose frame to these interests.</span></p> <p>Например, мы можем начать с общего интереса к предмету, что повлечет за собой возникновение аналитических категорий, на основании которых формируется методический комплекс исследования. То есть, личный интерес к теме, общие теоретические установки вашей дисциплины становятся отправными точками исследования, позволяющими развивать, а не ограничивать наше теоретическое понимание проблематики исследования.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Это нормально, начинать исследование с собственной позиции, сложившейся на основе биографии и исследовательской традиции вашей дисциплины и школы, но надо отдавать себе отчет в их ограничениях и стремиться оставаться открытым к любым находкам на начальных стадиях исследования.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">In short, sensitizing concepts and disciplinary perspectives provide a place to start, not to end</span></p> <p><em>Сравнение с классической моделью количественного исследования.</em></p> <p>In contrast, the logico-deductive model of traditional quantitative research necessitates operationalizing established concepts in a theory as accurately as possible and deducing testable hypotheses about the relationships between these concepts. In this model; the research is locked into the original concepts.</p> <p>Из этого вытеает<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> преимущество качественной модели исследования</span>. Кармаз приводит пример:</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">This process, in which we chewed over the main problems of our project and made false starts and rethought it all over again, is hardly an exceptional beginning for a research project. It's just that researchers rarely report on all of this. However, an early failure to choose the right road does not have to mean you are ultimately trapped in a dead-end .... Revise your strategy on the basis of that result and you might be able to move on to another result</span></p> <p><strong>Объем</strong><strong> наблюдений</strong><strong></strong></p> <p>For both Glaser and Stern, small samples and limited data do not pose problems because grounded theory methods aim to develop conceptual categories and thus data collection is directed to illuminate properties of a category and relations between categories.</p> <p><em>Вопросы, чтобы определить, достаточно ли собрано данных</em></p> <p>• Have I collected enough background data about persons, processes, and settings to have ready recall and to understand and portray the full range of contexts of the study?</p> <p>"" Have I gained detailed descriptions of a range of participants' views and actions?

Поверхностный анализ. <em>А мне нравится идея налетов. Нафиг взаимопонимание. Думаю, в случае анализа блогов можно себе это позволить. В конце концов, этика сводится к практическим целям нашего исследования и собственным идеалам исследователя.</em></p> <p>По мнению автора, надо постараться увидеть мир глазами людей. Конечно, невозможно понять, что они думают, но мы должны приблизиться к этому через приемы интерпретации. Необходимо уважать мнения респондентов, хотя можно и не соглашаться с ними. Пример Kristin Luker's (1984) book Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood по взглядам pro-life and pro-choice.</p> <p><em>Базовые</em><em> вопросы</em><em> граунд</em><em>-теории</em></p> <p>Thus, the first grounded theory question to ask follows:</p> <p>• What's happening here? (Glaser, 1978)</p> <p>This question spawns looking at what is happening at either of two levels:</p> <p>• What are the basic social processes? • What are the basic social psychological processes?</p> <p><em>Или так вот, менее фундаментально:</em></p> <p>• From whose point of view is a given process fundamental?</p> <p>From whose view is it marginal? •</p> <p>&nbsp;How do the observed social processes emerge?</p> <p>How do participants' actions construct them? •</p> <p>Who exerts control over these processes?</p> <p>Under what conditions?</p> <p>&nbsp;• What meanings do different participants attribute to the process?</p> <p>&nbsp;How do they talk about it?</p> <p>What do they emphasize?</p> <p>What do they leave out?</p> <p>• How and when do their meanings and actions concerning the process change?</p> <p><em>Что стоит контролировать, чтобы получить качественные данные:</em></p> <p>• Attending to actions and processes as well as to words</p> <p>• Delineating the context, scenes, and situations of action carefully</p> <p>• Recording who did what, when it occurred, why it happened (if you can ascertain the reasons), and how it occurred</p> <p>• Identifying the conditions under which specific actions, intentions, and processes emerge or are muted • Looking for ways to interpret these data</p> <p>• Focusing on specific words and phrases to which participants seem to attribute particular meaning</p> <p>• Finding taken-for-granted and hidden assumptions of various participants;</p> <p>&nbsp;showing how they are revealed through and affect actions.</p> <p>В этом смысле, материал блогов, конечно, одномерный.

How do those meanings reflect a particular social, historical, and perhaps organizational context? • What is the structure of the text? • How does its structure shape what is said?

Your codes show how you select, separate, and sort data to begin an analytic accounting of them.</p> <p>Qualitative codes take segments of data apart, name them in concise terms, and propose an analytic handle to develop abstract ideas for interpreting each segment of data. <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">AB we code, we ask: which theoretical categories might these statements indicate?</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Grounded theory coding generates the bones of your analysis.</span> Theoretical integration will assemble these bones into a working skeleton. Thus, coding is more than a beginning; it shapes an analytic frame from which you build the analysis.</p> <p>The codes take form together as elements of a nascent theory that explains these data and directs further data-gathering</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Grounded theory coding consists of at least two main phases: 1) an initial phase involving naming each word, line, or segment of data followed by 2) a focused, selective phase that uses the most significant or frequent initial codes to sort, synthesize, integrate, and organize large amounts of data.</span></p> <p>The actual research you conduct through analyzing your data likely differsat least somewhat-from what you may have plauned earlier in a research or grant proposal.</p> <p>The logic of grounded theory coding differs from quantitative logic that applies preconceived categories or codes to the data.</p> <p>Наша задача (на этапе первичного кодирования) состоит в том, чтобы максимально приблизиться к точке зрения объекта, при этом отдавая себе отчет в том, что привнесение нашего собственного элемента интерпретации неизбежна.</p> <p>Initial coding should stick closely to the data.

В противном случае, коды будут выражать взгляд постороннего наблюдателя, что противоречит принципам ГТ. Просто получится, что рутинная рационализация представляется в качестве аналитических инсайтов.</p> <p>A code for coding:</p> <p>• Remain open</p> <p>• Stay close to the data</p> <p>• Keep your codes simple and precise</p> <p>• Construct short codes</p> <p>• Preserve actions</p> <p>• Compare data with data</p> <p>• Move quickly through the data.</p> <p><strong>Кодирование </strong><strong>word </strong><strong>by </strong><strong>word</strong></p> <p>Актуально для документов определенного типа и для интернет-источников</p> <p><strong>Line-by-Line Coding</strong></p> <p>line-by-line coding means naming each line of your written data</p> <p>Может показаться затруднительным, поскольку не каждая строчка несет в себе смысл. Тем не менее, очень эвристичное упражение, поскольку натыкаешься на множество смыслов, которые ускользнули бы при тематическом анализе.</p> <p>Line-by-line coding works particularly well with detailed data about fundamental empirical problems or processes whether these data consist of interviews, observations, documents, or ethnographies and autobiographies.</p> <p>Engaging in line-by-line coding helps you to refocus later interviews.</p> <p><em>flexible strategies help you code: </em></p> <p>• Breaking the data up into their component parts or properties</p> <p>• Defining the actions on which they rest</p> <p>• Looking for tacit assumptions</p> <p>• Explicating implicit actions and meanings</p> <p>&nbsp;• Crystallizing the significance of the points</p> <p>• Comparing data with data</p> <p>• Identifying gaps in the data.</p> <p>Build your analysis step-by-step from the ground up without taking off on theoretical flights of fancy.</p> <p>Hence, the grounded theory method itself contains correctives that reduce the likelihood that researchers merely superimpose their preconceived notions on the data.</p> <p>Initial codes help you to separate data into categories and to see processes. – Получается, категории – это то, что формируется постфактум, сначала создаются коды. Здесь тоже все поставлено с головы на ноги.</p> <p>В процессе кодирования необходимо сохранять критичность – но не по отношению к респондентам, а по отношению к своим данным. В следующих аспектах:</p> <p>• What process(es) is at issue here? How can I define it?</p> <p>• How does this process develop?</p> <p>• How does the research participant(s) act while involved in this process? "" What does the research participant(s) profess to think and feel while involved in this process? What might his or her observed behavior indicate?</p> <p>• When, why, and how does the process change?</p> <p>• What are the consequences of the process?</p> <p><strong>Line </strong><strong>by </strong><strong>line </strong><strong>coding</strong></p> <p>В общем, от случая к случаю. Говорят, особенно полезно с собственными записями наблюдений, поскольку там и так используются свои слова.</p> <p><strong>Сравнение</strong></p> <p>Очень важный эмпирический прием. Сравниваем разные случаи. Чем более рутинной и привычной кажется наблюдение, тем сложнее выйти на уровень абстракции. Может помочь сопоставление с собственными ожиданиями относительно наблюдений, если они не оправдываются. Но необходимо относиться к своей точке зрения не как к истине, а как к одной в ряду многих.</p> <p>Our task is to make analytic sense of the material, which may challenge taken-for-granted understandings.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Careful coding also helps you to refrain from imputing your motives, fears, or unresolved personal issues</span></p> <p><strong>In Vivo Codes</strong></p> <p>Grounded theorists generally refer to codes of participants' special terms as in vivo codes.</p> <p><em>three kinds of in vivo codes prove to be useful: </em></p> <p>"" Those general terms everyone 'knows' that flag condensed but significant meanings o A</p> <p>participant's innovative term that captures meanings or experience</p> <p>• Insider shorthand terms specific to a particular group that reflect their perspective.</p> <p><strong>Focused coding</strong> \\</p> <p>The strength of grounded theory coding derives from this concentrated, active involvement in the process. You act upon your data rather than passively read them.</p> <p>Используются те же самые коды, что и в первичном кодировании.</p> <p>Даже на этом эттапе могут появляться идеи, провоцирующие редактирование системы кодов. Наборы кодов могут конденсироваться в один, из них могут складываться категории.</p> <p><strong>Axial Coding </strong></p> <p>Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998; Strauss, 1987) present a third type of coding, axial coding, to relate categories to subcategories. Axial coding specifies the properties and dimensions of a category.</p> <p>Strauss (1987: 64) views axial coding as building 'a dense texture of relationships around .the ""axis"" of a category. The purposes of axial coding are to sort, synthesize, and organize large amounts of data and reassemble them in new ways after open coding</p> <p>Initial coding fractures data into separate prices and distinct codes. Axial coding is Strauss and Corbin's (1998) strategy for bringing data back together again in a coherent whole.</p> <p>По строссу и Корбину, осевое кодирование позволяет преобразовать текст в концепты, а в этом и состоит суть аналитической работы с данными.</p> <p>Clarke views axial coding as elaborating a category and uses diagramming to integrate relevant categories.6 For her, an integrative diagram aims to link categories with categories to form a substantive theory of action.</p> <p>Axial coding provides a frame for researchers to apply. The frame may extend or limit your vision, depending on your subject matter and ability to tolerate ambiguity. Students who prefer to work with a preset structure will welcome having a frame. Those who prefer simple, flexible guidelines-and can tolerate ambiguity-do not need to do axial coding.</p> <p>А можно и без осевого кодирования – посто искать взамосвязи в системе категорий и субкатегорий – это рецепт от самой Кэти.</p> <p>_________________________________76</p> <p><strong>Theoretical coding</strong></p> <p>Glaser (1978: 72) introduced theoretical codes as conceptualizing 'how the substantive codes may relate to each other as hypotheses to be integrated into a theory.' In short, theoretical codes specify possible relationships between categories you have developed in your focused coding.</p> <p>По мнению Глэзера, теоретическое кодирование делает осевое кодирование не обязательным, поскольку так получается срастить историю, какой она была изначально. Нихуясебе перевел</p> <p>Theoretical codes are integrative; they lend form to the focused codes you have collected. These codes may help you tell an analytic story that has coherence.</p> <p>Теоретические коды могут строитсья на социологических основаниях или на распространенных аналитических концепциях. То есть, я могу создать два теоретических кода: Отрицание и… непонимание, замешательство.</p> <p>While coding, problems may arise by:</p> <p>• Coding at too general a level • Identifying topics instead of actions and processes • Overlooking how people construct actions and processes • Attending to disciplinary or personal concerns rather than participants' concerns • Coding out of context • Using codes to summarize but not to analyze. – Некоторые из этих пунктов дают основания полагать, что обоснованная теория все же не нацелена на часть материалов, на способность к анализу которых она претендует. Например, неструктурированные интервью. Там может вообще не быть никаких действий.</p> <p><strong>__________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Теоретическая выборка</strong></p> <p>Theoretical sampling means \ seeking pertinent data to develop your emerging theory.

In this paper, practical guidelines in using an online forum as a qualitative research method are proposed based on three previous online forum studies. First, the three studies are concisely described. Practical guidelines are proposed based on nine idea categories related to issues in the three studies: (a) a fit with research purpose and questions; (b) logistics; (c) electronic versus conventional informed consent process; (d) structure and functionality of online forums; (e) interdisciplinary team; (f) screening methods; (g) languages; (h) data analysis methods; and (i) getting participants’ feedback.","2012-11","2016-11-18 12:37:15","2016-11-18 12:37:15","2016-11-18 12:37:15","604-611","","11","30","","Comput Inform Nurs","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22918135 PMCID: PMC3727223","<p>Конспект</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","D:\Dropbox\Literature\Computers, informatics, nursing  CIN2012\Im_Chee_2012_Practical Guidelines for Qualitative Research Using Online Forums.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727223/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using NVivo as an example, it illustrates how software tools can facilitate analytical flexibility and how they can enhance transparency and trustworthiness of the qualitative research process. Following a brief discussion of the key characteristics, advantages and limitations of qualitative data analysis software, the article describes a qualitative content analysis of 230 newspaper articles, conducted to determine international media perceptions of New Zealand's environmental performance in connection with climate change and carbon emissions. The article proposes a multi-level coding approach during the analysis of news texts that combines quantitative and qualitative elements, allowing the researcher to move back and forth in coding and between analytical levels. The article concludes that while qualitative data analysis software, such as NVivo, will not do the analysis <span class=""FQSCharItalic"">for</span> the researcher, it can make the analytical process more flexible, transparent and ultimately more trustworthy. <!--EndFragment--></p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p><strong>Разница между качественным и количественным контент-анализом.</strong></p> <p><!--StartFragment-->Unlike quantitative content analysis with its long history as ""a research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication"" (BERELSON, 1952, p.18), QCA is context-specific (SCHREIER, 2012): it treats context as ""central to the interpretation and analysis of the material"" (KOHLBACHER, 2006, §80). QCA moves away from the focus on objectivity as maintained by traditional quantitative content analysis (BERELSON, 1952; BRYMAN, 2012; HOLSTI, 1969), in an attempt to allow for ""the subjective interpretation of the content of text data"" while maintaining ""the systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes or patterns"" (HSIEH &amp; SHANNON, 2005, p.1278). [<span class=""FQSParagraphNo"">5</span>] <!--EndFragment--></p> <p><strong>Основания для претензий КачКА на научность:</strong></p> <p><!--StartFragment--></p> <p class=""FQSText"">QCA is both systematic, flexible, and reduces data. As SCHREIER (2012, p.8) observes, the method is systematic in the sense that ""all relevant material is taken into account; a sequence of steps is followed during the analysis, regardless of your material; and you have to check your coding for consistency (reliability)."" QCA is further flexible in that the coding frame is adapted to the material and research questions at hand (SCHREIER, 2012). Furthermore, data reduction occurs through limiting analysis to relevant parts. [<span class=""FQSParagraphNo"">6</span>]</p> <p class=""FQSText"">QCA keeps transparency as one of the main advantages of classical content analysis (BRYMAN, 2012) intact, while attempting to synthesize two contradictory methodological principles: openness and theory-guided investigation</p> <p class=""FQSText"">&nbsp;It has to be noted that maintaining a strict distinction between quantitative and qualitative content analysis is not always useful or possible.</p> <p class=""FQSText"">Возможнен количественный анализ качественных данных, и наоборот.</p> <p class=""FQSText"">QCA allows a focus on quantitative aspects of the research data that are most relevant to the research question</p> <p class=""FQSText"">Основной принцип КачКА состоит в том, что критерии для создания кодов вытекают из вопросов исследования и теоретических принципов ученого, а категории выводятся индуктивно, на основе самого текста.</p> <p class=""FQSText"">Mayring выделяет три основных типа кодирования в качКА: обобщение, экспликация и структурирование.</p> <p class=""FQSText"">A key difference between QDA in general and QCA in particular is that the first focuses on the significance of observations, aiming for interpretations that do justice to a whole body of texts, whereas the second takes a somewhat more pragmatic approach by including quantitative aspects.</p> <p class=""FQSText""><strong>Классификация источников:</strong></p> <p class=""FQSText""><strong></strong>Имеет смысл составлять табличку регистрации данных, параллельно с их поиском и скачиванием:<strong></strong>For our analysis of news articles, we chose the attributes country, year, newspaper, article title, author, author position, and tone</p> <p class=""FQSText"">В качественном анализе данных возможно и индуктивное, и дедуктивное кодировани:</p> <p class=""FQSText"">For example, inductive coding—starting with a detailed analysis of sources, such as news articles, and generating concepts and ideas as themes emerge—will be the preferred strategy for those following a grounded theory strategy (BAZELEY, 2007).

Content analysis is the process of “summarizing, quantitative analysis of messages that relies on the scientific method (including attention to objectivity, intersubjectivity, a priori design, reliability, validity, generalizability, replicability, and hypothesis testing) and is not limited as to the types of variables that may be measured or the context in which the messages are created or presented” [Neuendorf, 2002, p. 10].</p> <p>Traditionally, content analysis involves the following steps: (1) selecting a topic, (2) deciding on the sample, (3) defining concepts or units to be counted, (4) constructing categories, (5) creating coding forms, (6) training coders, (7) collecting data, (8) determining inter-coder reliability, (9) analyzing data, and (10) reporting results. Traditional content analysis involves human subjective interpretation. Thus, the classification procedure should be reliable to ensure consistency among different coders and the same coders over time. For this reason, validity, inter-coder reliability, and intra-coder reliability have been the subject of extensive research [Krippendorff, 2004].</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DMEKSQJV\16_2_p05.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

По данным исследовательских компаний более 80% крупных фирм планируют в ближайшие два года начать использовать решения для машинного перевода. Этому есть следующие объяснения: машинный перевод становится всё более качественным и является уже серьёзным инструментом ведения бизнеса. Его используют в своей работе такие крупные корпорации, как IBM, Xerox, General Motors, Saab, Kodak, Boeing. Это не означает, что гиганты экономят на живых переводчиках, просто если Вам нужно получить пусть не совсем гладкий, но зато быстрый перевод материала с веб-сайта или письма, гораздо проще обратиться к специальной компьютерной программе или интернет-сервису, чем к переводчику. Однако и здесь существует обратная сторона медали: чтобы другой человек, который тоже пользуется машинным переводом, понял Вас, приходится писать на так называемом «контролируемом языке», специально адаптированном под «мышление» компьютера. Общеупотребительная лексика и простые, но полные предложения на таком языке будут с большой долей вероятности переведены корректно. «Контролируемые» тексты гораздо легче поддаются машинному переводу и соответственно снижаются затраты компании на локализацию документа. Другой вопрос – что дороже: иметь в штате своего переводчика или тратить время на обучение сотрудников правилам «контролируемого языка».</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eliot Freidson formalizes professionalism by treating it as an ideal type grounded in the political economy; he presents the concept as a third logic, or a more viable alternative to consumerism and bureaucracy. He asks us to imagine a world where workers with specialized knowledge and the ability to provide society with especially important services can organize and control their own work, without directives from management or the influence of free markets.Freidson then appraises the present status of professionalism, exploring how traditional and national variations in state policy and organization are influencing the power and practice of such professions as medicine and law. Widespread attacks by neoclassical economists and populists, he contends, are obscuring the social value of credentialism and monopolies. The institutions that sustain professionalism in our world are simply too useful to both capital and state to dismiss.","2001","2016-10-25 08:50:29","2016-10-25 15:23:54","","","240","","","","","","","","","","University of Chicago Press","Chicago","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Professionalism-Third-Logic-Practice-Knowledge/dp/0226262030","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In globalizing markets, professional<br />services are financed and structured differently,<br />with new competitive dynamics, venture<br />capitalists, private equity funds, as well as <em>transnational</em><br /><em>governance regimes and standards that make</em><br /><em>state regulation and protected professional labor</em><br /><em>markets relative phenomena</em> (also Faulconbridge and<br />Muzio 2012; Ramirez 2010).</p> <p>&nbsp;О необходимости рассматривать трансформации профессий в общем социетальном контексте:&nbsp;This is emphasized in recent analyses<br />of the reconfiguration of professional work (e.g.<br />Noordegraaf 2013; Kirkpatrick and Noordegraaf<br />2015) echoing earlier signals on the so-called ‘mutation’<br />of professionalism (Adler and Kwon 2013; also<br />Adler et al. 2008).<strong> </strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">In times with limited</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">(financial) means and growing and varied (citizen)</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">expectations, <em>professional services will have to become</em></span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""><em>better and better organized.</em></span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">In short, reconfigurations of professional work</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">must be tied to both economic and social, as well as</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">cultural, technological, and demographic shifts (for</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">oversight e.g. Noordegraaf 2011; 2013; also, Adler</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">and Kwon 2013; Brint 2015). <em>These shifts, we argue</em></span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""><em>beneath, influence</em> (1) the nature of cases treated by</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">professionals, (2) the number of cases that are treated,</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">and (3) the climate in which cases are treated.</span></p> <p><strong>Основные социетальные изменения:</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>1. Экономические - кризис 2008 (вспомнить контраргумент Сюсскинда: рост возобновляется, количество работы для профессионалов продолжает уменьшаться).</p> <p>2. Социальные - возможность оценки качества профессионального сервиса.</p> <p>3. Культурные - менее терпимое отношение к неудачам и ошибкам профессионалов</p> <p>4. Технологические - прозрачность профессиональных сервисов, альтернативные способы доступа к экспертному знанию (заимствовал термин у Сюсскинда).</p> <p>5. Демографические - женщины становятся профессионалами, распространяется частичная занятость (ср. менталитет профессионала 24/7)</p> <p>Все это ведет, кстати, к расслоению в среде профессионалов.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Кажется, предлагается идея на перспективу, что профессионалами станут те, кто сумеет профессионально организовывать услуги и производство продукции в своей области, причем оставаясь в логике профессии.</span></p> <p><strong>Вывод</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>Какой-то спорный. Получается, при гибридном организации труда профессионалов, профессионалы и менеджеры существуют раздельно, но в тесном взаимодействии. В перспективе, эта дихотомия должна быть преодолена, поскольку требования к выполняемой работе повышаются, и ее становится возможным выполнять лишь в условиях, когда организованность становится частью профессиональной работы (это и есть преодоление гибридности)</p> <p>В результате, новые профессионалы должны:</p> <p>1. Осваивать наиболее новые элементы экспертного знания и технологий, научиться работать коллективно, что должно вести к увеличению качества их работы</p> <p>2. Должны уметь сортировать поток работы, определять приоритетные проблемы и быть очень ответственными</p> <p><strong>Итак, 4 вида профессиональной работы:</strong></p> <p>1. Pure professionalism, aimed at restoring a traditional<br />professional logic, free from and<br />protected against managerial logics. The<br />professional is privileged, in order to optimize<br />case treatment.<br />2. Controlled professionalism, aimed at disciplining<br />professional work within organizational<br />settings and structures. Products are privileged,<br />instead of professionals, in order to<br />get results.<br />3. Managed professionalism, aimed at hybridizing<br />professional/organizational logics, in<br />terms of structures, systems and roles.<br />Meaningful professional performance is privileged,<br />in order to link case treatment to organizational<br />challenges.<br />4. Organizing professionalism, aimed at going<br />beyond hybridity, especially by embedding<br />organizing and organizing roles and capacities<br />within professional action. Professional<br />processes are privileged, in order to deal<br />with multiple cases in demanding<br />environments.</p>; <p>Конспект Тюлюпо А.В.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BVC357GF\noordegraaf2015.pdf","","оп1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

В качестве примера - перевод Фейсбука. Кроме того, если возможны последующие правки перевода участниками сообщества, то качество перевода приближается к идеальному .Kelly et al. (2011: 75) believe that, if applied to a translation crowdsourcing project such as Facebook, the translate-edit-proofread (TEP) model used predominantly in the translation industry would have numerous drawbacks. НАпример, единоличная редакторская правка переводов сотрудником компании может демотивировать волонтеров.</p> <p>2. Sixteen bloggers wrote posts supporting pro bono translation work within <em>non-profit initiatives.</em> The most commonly cited projects are: the Haiti Relief Effort, Translators Without Borders (TWB), Kiva, The Rosetta Foundation, and Global Voices. Some see this as a way of ‘starting out’ as a translator. Others see this activity as a way of giving back to a worthwhile community (e.g. Translation Times, 27 October 2011). For example, the Firefox browser and OmegaT, a free Translation Memory tool, were developed within the FOSS framework. Однако в целом, не кажется, что профессиональные переводчики считают FOSS делом, достойным волонтерства.</p> <p>3. Возможности для включения профессионалов в процесс совместной работы. Предполагается, что профессиональные переводчики будут получать достойное вознаграждение.</p> <p><strong>Критика:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Коммерческие организации, которые открывают проекты краудсорсинговых переводов, не предлагая вознаграждения (LinkedIn).<strong> </strong></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Интересный случай:</span></p> <p>In 2009, LinkedIn, a social network platform for professionals, asked its members to complete a survey about their interest in translating the LinkedIn platform via translation crowdsourcing. One question asked to indicate the type of incentive participants would expect, which included<br />‘because it’s fun’, ‘translation leader board’, ‘upgraded LinkedIn account’, and ‘other’. Of the approximately 12,000 LinkedIn members who responded (with about 50% being professional translators), the most popular incentive was ‘upgraded LinkedIn account’ (5,054), with ‘other’ incentive coming in fourth place (3,280). The majority of these ‘other’ respondents requested monetary compensation (Posner 2009)</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Many professional translators reacted negatively to this request: a LinkedIn group ‘Translators against crowdsourcing by commercial businesses’ was set up</span>, and Matthew Bennett, a professional translator, wrote a blog post on the topic ‘LinkedIn infuriates professional translators: 10 big questions’.</p> <p>Common Sense Advisory (CSA), an independent language-industry market research company, claims the prospect of ‘free labour’ cited by many professional translators is not the motivation for companies engaging in translation crowdsourcing initiatives (Ray and Kelly 2011). Instead, they do so for reasons of speed, quality and reach (Kelly 2009b). However, bloggers in this study do not always trust these industry reports (see for example, Financial Translator 28 November 2011, 28 May 2012, 8 June 2011; Translation Tribulations 10 July 2012), since it is not always clear to translators how independent the role of the CSA is within the translation industry.</p> <p><em>2. Этика</em></p> <p>Translation Tribulations (2 December 2013) wants to highlight “the creeping deprofessionalization and demonetization promoted by Translators Without Borders (TWB) or similar programs and their well-paid corporate advocates”. Там же есть интересная дискуссия по этому поводу, между топикстартером, представителями ТБГ и проф. переводчиками.</p> <p>Вообще, <span style=""background-color: #99cc00;"">McDonough Dolmaya (2011b: 103)</span> пишет об эксплуатации посредством различных маркетинговых механизмов и, очевидно, случай с волонтерскими переводами вполне соответствует данной категории.</p> <p><em>Transparency of the translation process i</em>s linked to the visibility of the translator. Even though many for-profits employ professional translators to check the quality of the ‘free translations’, this is not made clear to the users of the translations.<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> Therefore, while the visibility of translation and translators is increased among the general public, there is also an increased perception that translation can be done by anyone who has knowledge of two languages, to become a translator requires little formal training, and it could be considered more suitable as a hobby rather than a profession</span> <span style=""background-color: #99cc00;"">(McDonough Dolmaya 2011b: 104).</span></p> <p><em>3. Качество</em></p> <p>The main point across all posts is that the quality of translations produced via translation crowdsourcing is compromised, due to amateurs carrying out the work coupled with the low payment or free model used.</p> <p>Although professional translators worry about the lack of quality within translation crowdsourcing projects, in some of them quality issues are taken very seriously. Facebook for example has been very transparent about the steps it took to implement quality control in its translations (Kelly et al. 2011: 86, Wong 2008). Their quality model relies on two basic components: (1) the votes of a community of users on translations proposed by the members of that same community, and (2) an overview of the entire cycle by professional translators (Jiménez-Crespo 2011: 135)</p> <p>4. Подрыв авторитета</p> <p>Профессиональные переводчики считали себя наиболее подходящими кандидатами для многих работ, но заказчики перевода не всегда с этим соглашаются. Более того, переводчики упускают из виду тот факт, что волонтерский перевод пользователями сообщества полностью соответствует принципам организации Веб 2.0, и даже не столь важно, отличается ли этот перевод высоким качеством.</p> <p>Twelve bloggers describe the low rates offered by LSPs and cloud marketplaces, commonly referred to as bulk translation agencies. Some bloggers are clearly irritated by the publicity cloud marketplaces receive, often being lauded as the new face of translation in the media, with most of the focus being on the technology rather than the human translators (e.g. Patenttranslator 27 March 2014, 3 April 2014). Other bloggers argue, both implicitly and explicitly, that translators should present themselves as a powerful authority who has control over work and pay conditions. The bloggers therefore argue that professional translators should use their authority to distance themselves altogether from the part of the market occupied by bulk translation agencies (see also Dam 2013: 23).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9TBXQHWF\art_flanagan.pdf","","оп1; краудсорсинг","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud-based machin e translation (MT) and the social web now give them two additional options, raw MT and crowdsourcing. This article reports on the emerging modality of paid crowdsourcing, as conducted since 2008 by companies such as SpeakLike, Gengo, One Hour Translation, tolingo and subsequent entrants into what we term here as cloud marketplaces. Paid crowdsourcing represents an entirely new way of managing translation, and translation buyers seem to be increasingly turning to cloud marketplaces to find it. Thus far, however, this trend has been ignored by both academy and industry observers.<br />Our initial premise was that cloud marketplaces would fill the gap between raw MT and unpaid crowdsourcing on the one end, and conventional LSP practices on the other. It was expected that, compared with LSPs, cloud vendors would offer faster, less expensive services offset by lower quality. It was also expected that they would offer translators lower rates and poorer working conditions. However, a close reading of the published service offerings indicates that the demarcation lines between cloud marketplaces and conventional LSPs are not as clear cut as first thought.<br />KEYWORDS<br />Translation crowdsourcing; paid crowdsourcing; cloud marketplaces; cloud vendor; professional translation; language service providers.</p>; <p>Библиография</p> <p>Cronin, Michael (2013).

It emerged around 2008, pioneered by Gengo, One Hour Translations, SpeakLike and tolingo1, and fuelled by the sheer reach of cloud computing itself. Its surge was made possible by two other events that took place in 2008: on the one hand, Facebook succeeding with crowdsourcing the translation of its user interface (Smith 2008) and, on the other, Google shelving its mooted Translation Center whose goal was, precisely, to connect everyone who needed translation with everyone who could provide it (Google Blogoscoped 2008; Ruscoe 2009).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Было два основных поставщика пер. услуг: агенства и ЛСП (разница не вполне ясна). Возникал дефицит переводов. Пытались постредактировать, но кач-во МТ было недостаточно. Еслественно, был соблазн прибегать к услугам билингвов с опытом в данной сфере, но без проф. образования - отношение к такой опции среди переводчиков известно.</p> <p><strong>Изменения:</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>1. Ну, Веб 2.0. Р2Р коммуникации и т.д. Это естественно ведет к повышению спроса, но параллельно:</p> <p>2. То, что раньше было крайней мерой в ситуации дифицита проф. перевода, становится полноценным вариантом, со своими преим. и недостатками: raw MT, by far the cheapest and fastest; and crowdsourcing among bilinguals, conveniently situated between MT and expert human output in terms of speed and cost.</p> <p>Множество сфер, в которых м.п. себя оправдывает. Но, примеры итак очевидны.</p> <p><strong>Определение краудсорсинга:</strong> Crowdsourcing involves taking tasks traditionally performed by employees or contractors, chunking them into small, manageable components and distributing them through an open call to a community (Howe 2006). For translation, the sentence is that small, manageable chunk. In fact, professional translators already work at the sentence level while using CAT tools.</p> <p><em>В итоге, появились три вполне рабочие варианта перевода: МТ, толпа и профи.</em></p> <p><em>Вот хорошо:</em> Краудсорсинг - не значит волонтерский.</p> <p><strong>Specifically, this article is concerned with the procurement of professional translators to work in paid crowdsourced projects.&nbsp;</strong>Вопросы, связанные с проблематикой редактирования машинного перевода здесь не рассматриваются, хотя отмечают, что они тоже очень важны.</p> <p>Первый масштабный прецедент крауд. перевода - Фейсбук (весьма интересные детали, промущены), а теорет. осмысление - статья Crowdsourcing by Howard - И все в 2008 году.</p> <p>Большие перспективы в этом деле&nbsp; - у неком. организаций. Обычно, у них есть красивые и привлекательные лозунги, чтобы привлечь переводчиков - проблема в другом, площадка тоже нужна, а программисты за бесплатно работать не любят (Jimenez-Crespo 2013: 194).</p> <p>Другая область, в которой распространены краудс. переводы - FOSS. Two journals, Linguistica Antverpiensia (O’Hagan 2011) and The Translator (Susam-Sarajeva and Luis Perez Gonzalez 2012) have recently devoted special issues to this broad phenomenon.</p> <p>Подробно рассматривается развитие софта, позволяющего обеспечить работу толп для самых разных организаций. Пропущено - нет смысла просто читать, надо гуглить параллельно.</p> <p>Вообщем, такие типы софта:</p> <p>1. Позволяющие работать в классическом режиме translation-editing-proofreading (TEP) (не хватает гибкости, не соответстует принципам ВЕБ 2.0)</p> <p>2. Lingotek и др. - система голосования.

Часто говорится, что работают профессионалы.</p> <p>Advertised work domains betray a catch-all approach, with no job too small, too big, or too specialised. However, some emphasise expertise in particular fields. Одно агенство предлагает услуги переводчиков в самых разнообразных областях, при ставке charged at the expert rate of 0.09 US dollars instead of the 0.79 base rate.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Сравнение LSPи краудс. </span>Translator allocation and recruiting differs between conventional LSPs and cloud marketplaces: the former normally claim exclusively professional teams, while the latter invites semi-professionals too. LSPs target specialised areas, prefer or require conventional CAT tools, and follow standard TEP waterfall management. Cloud marketplaces focus on agile management with no tendering required; workflows appear structured more toward delivery times. Однако происходят смешения: краудс. площадки говорят о специализации, ЛСП предлагают работу профессионалов в похожем на краудсорсинг режиме, чтобы справиться с наиболее срочными заказами.</p> <p><strong>What do cloud marketplaces offer translators?</strong></p> <p>A decade ago, working as a translator involved advertising, direct marketing, peer networking, running a website, listing oneself with translation agencies, and completing sophisticated online profiles in Proz or similar translation portals. Apart from the core language transfer skills, plus technical and organisational proficiency, professional translators had to woo clients as well. The job description had acquired a significant entrepreneurial dimension.</p> <p>Cloud marketplaces acknowledge and embrace those who simply find translating fun or convenient. Being paid to translate has never looked easier.</p> <p>Большинство сайтов открыто приглашают полупрофессионалов (что бы это ни значило) и просто людей, владеющих двумя языками. Лишь в некоторых случаях критерии отбора более строги:&nbsp; “Translators with relevant academic history and work experience are welcome to join the OHT platform. Merely being a native speaker is not enough to qualify as a translator.” All want applicants to work into their native language only, and to pass some sort of test.</p> <p>Некоторые платформы даже поощряют или не препятствуют постредактированию машинного перевода.</p> <p>Главное требование во всех компаниях - выполнять небольшие элементы перевода в срок. Для примера, в 1-часовом переводчике (премиум-сегмент): 1 hour of translation time for every 200 words in the document and up to 8-10 hours per working day</p> <p>&nbsp;Вообще, клиентоориентированность провоцирует крайне требовательную и жесткую среду для переводчика, возникает потогонная система, которая может даже открыто признаваться руководством сервисов. Например, механический турок. Ну и обозначения работы говорят сами за себя.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Расценки: </span>Translator remuneration (below expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) is tight, and there is little room for negotiation. The base per-word price advertised to clients runs from 0.12 (Tethras) to 0.03 (TextMaster). Only a few advertise the rates offered to translators: One Hour Translation charges clients at a base level of 0.079 per word, and pays its translators at 0.05; Gengo reports 0.05 and 0.03 respectively; TextMaster, 0.03 and 0.01.</p> <p>industry standard output of 2,500 words daily. (считается для профессиональных переводчиков в ЛСП)</p> <p>for example, the average minimums reported by Proz members working between English and major languages are never below 0.07. In the case of Spanish - English, we find a 0.08 minimum and a 0.11 standard as reported by 12,343 ProZ respondents3. A survey of 1,750 translators by the Institute of Languages and the Chartered Institute of Linguists in the United Kingdom in 2011 made similar findings for the same pair (£0.65 for agency clients, and between £0.75 and £0.79 for direct clients – Gardam et al. 2012).</p> <p>Еще одним следствием развития этих технологий является подрыв позиций переводчиков в развитых странах - понятно, за счет чего.</p> <p>A 2012 Common Sense Advisory survey of 3,700 providers in 114 countries found “translation prices have tumbled” in the previous two years. “[A]lthough demand for translation<br />services is up and on the rise, the average price has been falling, over 30% since 2010 and over 40% since 2008,” writes Muzii (2013: 7).</p> <p>Democratisation of the technology has been crucial. A decade ago, possession and mastery of complex localisation tools (Catalyst, Passolo) conferred advantage and prestige. Such specialisation has become virtually irrelevant. Specific tools developed by the likes of Easyling and PhraseApp have powered cloud marketplaces and helped usher the crowd into nearly all corners of the industry. Sites such as Easyling allow translators to download the source and work offline on conventional CAT tools (a very pro-style practice). However, we may shortly expect new platforms on which memory and glossary information is conveyed unobtrusively to the user interface, making on-prem CAT obsolete as well. Mastery of CAT tools does not offer professional translators now the advantage and prestige it did a decade ago.</p> <p><strong>Безусловно, ограничение любого MT и крауда:</strong><strong></strong>Any text whose interpretation presupposes a degree of non-literal or privileged understanding is, to a greater or lesser extent, being uncooperative. This is what expert translators recognise and develop strategies for, and what others cannot be consistently relied upon to handle (Garcia and Stevenson 2011).</p> <p>The translation industry has both room and need for a spectrum spanning professionals, semi-professionals, casual aficionados and even untrained volunteers. Quality is not always critical, and there is nothing inherently wrong with enterprises, institutions and NGOs dipping into the appropriate “cognitive surplus” (Shirky 2010). Translation is essentially a manifestation of bilingual literacy, and j<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">ust as no one needs to be a professional writer to write, no one needs to be a professional translator to translate.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Делается вывод, что расценки краудсорса минимально примемлемы лишь для стран с низким доходом, и нет никаких социальных гарантий и гарантий занятости. <em>От себя добавлю, что по мере распространения площадок такого типа в развив. странах, можно ожидать дальнейшего снижения ставок.</em></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Негативное последствие:</span></strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">The extreme emphasis on curving rates is reportedly driving the experts out (Sulzberger 2012), which is natural enough if the same effort and self-discipline will be better rewarded in other pursuits.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><em>Ну вот и в поле социологии профессий, можно сослаться на это, когда буду увязывать с ней тему перевода: </em>Of course, this is not just happening to translators.

Вернуться и законспектировать задним числом</p> <p><strong>Определение</strong></p> <p>Jeff Howe, who coined the term “crowdsourcing” in a seminal article appearing in Wired<br />magazine (Howe, 2006), defines it as “...the act of taking a job traditionally performed by a<br />designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group<br />of people in the form of an open call.”</p> <p><em>Это как начальная точка для собственного, более точного определения.</em></p> <p>Многие в академической среде отождествляют краудсорсинг с наиболее привлекательными его видами, связанными с инновациями. Иногда даже встречаются определения краудсорсинга как феномена, основанные на этом принципе.</p> <p><strong>As a result, we present the following practical but rigorous definition of crowdsourcing:</strong><br />Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which organizations use predominantly<br />advanced Internet technologies to harness the efforts of a virtual crowd to<br />perform specific organizational tasks.</p> <p>То есть, краудсорсинг определяется тремя составляющими: стадом, использованием новейших информационных технологий и принципом аутсорсинга.</p> <p><em>crowdsourcing can first be viewed through the</em><br /><em>lens of outsourcing</em>. According to Lacity and Hirschheim (1993, p. 74), “outsourcing, in its most<br />basic form, can be conceived of as the purchase of a good or service that was previously provided<br />6<br />internally” from outside providers. Many information systems researchers also define it as<br />contracting of various internal business needs or functions to outside service providers (Kishore,<br />Rao, &amp; Nam, 2003).</p> <p><em>crowd - it is the online community that is expected to play the role of “service<br />providers” as producers, innovators, and problem solvers</em></p> <p><em>Advanced Interrnet Technologies</em></p> <p>In fact, excluding the Web 2.0 capabilities, the basic idea of crowdsourcing—on a very limited<br />scale—has hundreds of years of history</p> <p>Предшественником современного краудсорсинга представляется приз за решение проблемы (1714 год, англия, проблема долгих плаваний)</p> <p>НО!</p> <p>A unique strength of the social web is thus its capacity for collectively extracting the tacit<br />knowledge latent in the crowd’s brain, and for aggregating it into a structured and usable<br />knowledge format.</p> <p>What the crowdsourcing model is able to do is harness these key<br />features of advanced web technologies to fulfill previously difficult and costly organizational<br />endeavors. Crowdsourcing applications effectively funnel the crowd’s energies with a clear<br />business orientation and set of goals to be achieved</p> <p>In simpler terms, the crowdsourcing platform connects people, employs<br />their skill sets, and/or aggregates their knowledge, with the responding “crowd” being<br />strategically managed by the firm for the purpose of production, innovation or problem solving.</p> <p>While the social web has<br />transformed websites into collaborative social platforms and changed the concept of the<br />consumer into that of content creator, crowdsourcing is now forging the social web platform into<br />a collaborative production platform and the role of content creators into producers of goods and<br />services.</p> <p><strong>Часть по исследованию пропущена. Обсуждаются выборка, источники ее формирования. 2009 год.</strong></p> <p><strong>2 модели краудсорсинга (из 9), </strong>которые могут применяться для перевода:</p> <p>In the <strong>knowledge-building crowdsourcing mode</strong>l, the information- or knowledge-generation<br />process is outsourced to community users, and diverse types of incentive measures and<br />quality-control mechanisms are utilized to elicit quality knowledge and information that may be<br />latent in the virtual crowd’s “brain.” (см. интервью с менеджером Ackuna).</p> <p>the <strong>“Intermediary” model,</strong> such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, web users serve as a virtual work<br />force that follows the process of (1) Find (2) Finish, and (3) Earn through the web</p> <p>Примечание. Несмотря на то, что краудсорсинговые сервисы декларируют открытость предложения работодателя, в реальности могут существовать серьезные барьеры для работы над проектом. Проекты чаще всего выполняются индивидуально или в небольних закрытых группах.Но есть и полностью открытые для всех желающих платформы.</p> <p><strong>Системы менеджмента в краудсорсинге</strong></p> <p>In<br />crowdsourcing, managerial control systems can be defined as processes, policies, and<br />mechanisms designed to achieve specific business goals by effectively facilitating user<br />participation and eliciting their best knowledge and skills</p> <p>Составляющие:</p> <p>1) compensation<br />schemes, 2) trust-building systems, and 3) voting and commenting mechanisms.</p> <p><strong>Compensation^</strong>Большинство сайтов предлагало какое-либо вознаграждение. Половина - монетарное. Есть множество вариаций: просто баллы, возможность нанимать других участников сайта для своего проекта и др. + признание заслуг - в основном, для некоммерческих проектов.</p> <p><strong>Системы построения доверия</strong></p> <p>Online marketplaces are filled with uncertainty and risk. In the virtual working mode, a worker’s<br />skillset cannot be verified until the given task is delivered to buyers, and workers in turn are<br />uncertain if they will be compensated by buyers for the work they complete. These uncertainties<br />must be reduced to make crowdsourcing transactions successful.</p> <p>Одним из аппробированных в системе электронной коммерции средств построения доверия является система рейтингов. Исследования показывают, что благодаря этой системе может возникать премиальный сегмент рынка даже на полностью открытых и конкурентных площадках.+ система голосований и комментирования для пользователей площадки.</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\K3Z7D9UC\Crowdsourcing (SSRN).pdf","","оп1; краудсорсинг","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Следовательно, умеснто использовать термин ""перевод"".</p> <p>Эта работа исследует путь, которым отдельные идеи АНТ перетекли в орг. исследования, какую форму они приобрели в новом поле.</p> <p>АНТ возникает из СТС, в котором в центре внимания находился процесс социального конструирования научных фактов. АНТ позволяет учесть роль не-человеков в этом процессе - таким образом, АНТ - это теория конструирования научного знания, но она шире, чем социальное конструирование.</p> <p>АНТ изучает процесс построения стабильных гетерогенных сетей. В качестве основного метода здесь предлагается этнографическое исследование деятельности ученых.</p> <p>Три постулата АНТ для изучения науки и технологии: (Callon 1986b): generalised agnosticism - analytic impartiality as to whether actors are<br />involved in controversy; generalised symmetry - the use of an abstract and neutral<br />vocabulary to understand conflicting viewpoints of actors; and free association - the<br />repudiation of a priori distinctions between the social and the natural or the<br />technological (Michael 1996).</p> <p>Ученые заняты процессом гетерогенного инжиниринга, который выражается в политических, повседневных и специфически научных действиях и вовлекает множество других акторов: research funding bodies (government, industry, and<br />charities), instrumentation and materials manufacturers, professional peers and the<br />public</p> <p>Callon (1991: 140) defines an <span style=""background-color: #888888;"">'actor' </span>as “any entity able<br />to associate texts, humans, non-humans and money</p> <p>Не имеет смысла отдельно рассматривать роль человеков и не-человеков в сетях. Понятие перевода является наиболее важным элементом АНТ, для того, чтобы она могла быть использована в МОС.</p> <p>The term translation refers to the means by which actors come to exercise some<br />authority over the elements of which a network is composed.</p> <p>So, translation points to the way others aspirations are borrowed to support the<br />endeavours of the enrolling actor.</p> <p>Translation is also instigated by means of obligatory points of passage through which<br />entities can be persuaded to commit themselves to participation in the actor-network.</p> <p>So, for<br />Callon, ‘...to translate is to speak for, to be indispensable, and to displace.</p> <p>Успех актора в построении сети может измеряться ее масштабом и устойчивостью - насколько актору удалось убедить все задействованные сущности действовать в его интересах. Каллон называет это состояние конвергенцией.

Within three decades, a new work environment is shaking up the translator’s world. New types of translators are emerging. The balance between supply and demand is changing. However, we need adequate tools and methods to investigate the new hierarchy which has become established between translators, between different kinds of job markets. Journalists are like translators confronted with computerization and an influx of amateurs. With all those rapid changes, it is time to consider an economic turn in Translation Studies and also the implications for training.</p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p>Firstly, and with the goal of putting these changes more clearly into focus, we need to recall that <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">translation and interpreting are but one possible solution among many implemented in international, multilingual communications and relations</span>. - Мысль один в один та же, что и Сюсскинда</p> <p>В истории можно найти разные варианты способов доступа к знанию на другом языке, помимо перевода ((Lambert, 1989, p. 233)</p> <p>Английский стал сегодня Лингва Франка в бизнесе, науке и др. (House, 2003),</p> <p>Возникает новая рабочая среда для переводчиков. Новый вид программного обеспечения, основанное на облачных вычислениях: Among them, free or paid for, are: Translation Workspace, Wordbee, XTM Cloud, Google Translator Toolkit, and Lingotek. То есть, это уже не профессиональные программы, устанавливаемые на отдельных компьютерах. Эти программы позволяют creating translation memories, aligning texts, managing terminology, checking spelling and grammar, accessing and searching electronic corpuses, and machine translation</p> <p>Все эти факторы влияют на процесс перевода, организационные формы LSP и, в конечном итоге, на увеличение предложения.</p> <p>Отношение к любителям-переводчикам - очень хорошая иллюстрация моего интуитивного ощущения, что здесь имеет место массовое нарушение профессиональных норм:</p> <p>These fans are not translation professionals – hence, they transgress certain conventions and respected norms of the profession</p> <p>Краудсорсинг рассматривается как волонтерское явление. Причем, упоминаются только те площадки, на которых происходит редактирование переводов по принципу Википедии. Примеры инструментов, которые могут для этого использоваться: Traduwiki, Wikitranslate and Google Translate. Social media or socio-digital networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) take advantage of the passing craze in order to become more accessible to more people.</p> <p>Оценивает потенциальное влияние краудсорсинга как ограниченное (поскольку рассматривает здесь лишь не вознаграждаемый вид краудсорсинга): The impact of crowd-sourcing on the translation industry will be limited, despite the current euphoria of the discourse, and it will be most evident in only very visible instances.</p> <p>collaborative translation (teamwork) - Профессионалы используют те же технологии, только по-своему, для оперативного производства очень качественного перевода. Примеры: It is manifest in such sites as Proz, Translator’s Café, etc. “Cloud” cannot be confused with “crowd”.</p> <p>Вот это я не понял - Translation with open source tools, which are not necessarily free but which can be adapted to certain needs and redistributed to others, can be carried out by professionals, on a full-time basis.</p> <p>Выделяет особую форму краудсорсинга, в которой происходит коллективный перевод в гуманистических целях (переводчики без границ и др.) Здесь тоже могут участвовать профессиональные переводчики, но они сотрудничают для создания наилучшего перевода. Кажется, перевод Курсеры в ту же копилку. Однако, разграничение с краудсорсингом в вики-стиле представляется надуманным.</p> <p>Эти новые формы перевода походят друг на друга в одном: What brings all these groups together is a shift in the direction towards the actor (translator, user), as the producer of content.</p> <p>Хто все эти люди?</p> <p>Some Internet users are professionals, and concerned with developing their job profiles, others are activists clearly oriented by ideology, others are technophile amateurs, and still others are freelancers attempting to forge new niches.</p> <p>Рассматривается квалификация краудс. переводчиков у <span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">(Antonini, 2011)</span>. Выводить дихотомии и даже градации в этом вопросе очень затруднительно. Во всяком случае очевидно, что <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">развитие новых форм организации пер. деят. делает разделение по признаку наличия формальной квалификации все менее релевантным.</span> Литература по этому поводу: <span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">(Katan, 2011; Sela-Sheffy &amp; Shelsinger, 2009, 2010; Wadensjö, 2011; Wadensjö et al., 2007).</span> Авторы пытаются найти наиболее адекватные критерии для оценки профессионализма.</p> <p><em>Немножко моя мысль. Важно, что создатели всех этих площадок родом из другого мира, их совершенно не интересует, будут ли на них обитать ""профессионалы"" или ""любители"" - главное, чтобы работа шла и приносила им прибыль. То есть, профессионалы точно так же могут входить на эти площадки и использовать их в своих целях. - </em>Technologies could offer new opportunities and niches that did not exist before, in addition to the new problems they raise.</p> <p>А вот это уже он говорит, что стоит переводчикам и Айтишникам стоит договариваться. Отмечает тенденцию ухудшения качества перевода - он становится дословным, не учитывает аспектов восприятия.</p> <p>Делает оговорку, что коллективная работа профессиональных переводчиков ни в коем случае не является отличительной чертой информационной эпохи.</p> <p>И все же, разница есть: Digital society is not defined as a collectivity structured by mediating organizations (parties, unions, associations); rather, it is an ensemble of micro-units.</p> <p>Делается вывод, что будущее переводчиков может быть очень разным.</p> <p>Предлагается подойти к проблематике перевода (здесь и вопросы адекватности перевода и др.) с экономической точки зрения. В настоящее время можно выделить несколько рыночных ниш, в которых существуют различные условия труда и оплаты:</p> <p>1. Открытый для всех желающих. Заказы здесь фрагментированы, исполнители работ могут иметь самую разныю квалификацию и цели. Заказчики крайне неохотно прибегают к опрачиваемому труду.</p> <p>2. Защищенная ниша, связанная с переводом ответственных текстов. Именно здесь пасется большинство переводческих контор, позиции проф. переводчиков наиболее сильны. Заказчики - средний бизнес, имеющий международные интересы.</p> <p>3. Глобальный рынок. Мультинациональные перев. агенства... Ээээ, что-то непонятно.</p> <p>Опаньки, вот очень важная претензия переводчиков: In fact, until translation work can be regulated, recognized, and accredited both in terms of access and practice, like other liberal professions (doctors, architects, lawyers, notaries, etc.), these three markets (local and open, regional and protected, global and concentrated) will continue to not be impervious to one another.</p> <p>Другой важный вопрос - как перевод влияет на успех международного бизнеса. ... Многобукав. В общем, изучать множество экон. последствий разных стратегий перевода продукта, учитывать их. Кроме того, все эти разницы должны быть понятны и заказчикам.</p> <p>Мощно задвинул, внушает:</p> <p>An electronically configured world always demands more links between agents in the process, with pre- and/or post-editing, revision, re-reading, coordination of terminology, all carried out in the interest of the product’s final coherence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WNBFHX6N\article_4638_8301154b3bfe303a6e1c541f62c4e18a.pdf","","оп1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, humans are still the most reliable source to obtain meaningful informative evaluations. A recent model to obtain quicker and cheaper human evaluations is crowdsourcing. Non-professionals who choose to do so access a purposely-built environment made available by a company. Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Symantec and Twitter, among others, have already put this approach into practice for their translation activities. Major hurdles include the effort involved in building up and maintaining community, and quality control, i.e. the need for methods to detect and discard responses from inadequate participants.","2014-06-27","2016-10-08 06:23:37","2016-10-08 06:23:37","2016-10-08 06:23:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","YouTube","","","","","","","Crowdsourcing; Evaluation; Quality; Quality Evaluation; TAUS; Translation Quality; webinar; Welocalize","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3427 seconds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research on professions in the US, UK, Canada and Western<br />Europe shares many similarities, UK researchers have devoted more attention to professional<br />regulation, while their US counterparts focus instead on organizational challenges facing<br />professionals. Contrasting these empirical and theoretical approaches opens up new research<br />directions, and highlights the importance of socio-historical and cultural context to professions.<br />More international and comparative work is required to develop a better understanding of<br />professions and professional regulation.</p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p>(Gorman and Sandefur, 2011) говорят о том, что профессии продолжают изучаться, но под другими названиями: ‘sociology of occupations’, ‘sociology of<br />organizations’ and ‘social inequality’</p> <p>Критика с позиций теорий конфликта действительно сменилась on organizational arrangements and<br />rationalization trends that threaten to deprofessionalize expert workers + изменение <strong>индивидуальных траекторий профессионального развития. </strong>Но вообще, он с ними не соглашается на счет того, что социология профессий загибается.</p> <p>The sociology of professions is a burgeoning research field. A search of the literature databases Sociological Abstracts and SocIndex</p> <p>The most popular topic of articles on professions over the last 25 years has been inequalities in professional practice, and access to practice and rewards, by gender, race/ethnicity, immigration status and to a lesser extent, socio-economic status (in 27% of all articles identified). A large number of articles also document processes of professionalization and professional development, and/or provide case studies on the emergence of professional groups (24%). Also quite popular are the following: studies of deprofessionalization, challenges faced by dominant professions, and declining autonomy; studies of professional regulation, state–profession relations, and changing public policy affecting professions; and studies of the characteristics and experiences of professional workers, including accounts of labour turnover and job satisfaction. Rounding out the top 10 are theoretical articles: those exploring professions in organizations or applying organizational theory to professions; studies of interprofessional relations; and studies focusing on professionalism and trust, and/or knowledge and expertise. Scholars approach the field from many sociological traditions, including the sociology of work, social inequality, medical sociology, the sociology of law and the sociology of organizations. Health care professions (especially medicine and nursing) appear to be the most-studied groups, but the legal profession(s), social work, teaching, accounting, architecture, journalism and engineering are well-accounted for.</p> <p>В современных работах по социологии профессий наиболее часто ссылаются на классиков:</p> <p>Макс Вебер, Герберт Спенсер, Толкотт Парсонс, Пьер Бурдье.

Professionalism can be conceived as a set of symbolic resources<br />that (re)produce an occupational order, favoring expertise and craftsmanship. In<br />neo-liberal economies this order is contested and professional powers are distrusted;<br />professional work is seen as closed-off and conservative. Managers have<br />become important vehicles for rationalizing and innovating production, and<br />improving “value for money.” In fact, managerial “fields” are created, and conflicts<br />between managerial and professional fields are well documented. These<br />conflicts are ironic, as new classes of managers seek classic strategies of professionalization<br />as well as classic forms of professional capital for securing managerial<br />positions. They form professional associations, for instance, and invest in schooling,<br />credentials and work codes. This paper explores conflicts between professionals<br />and managers as “contests over symbolic capital.” We argue that<br />professional capital is appropriated by managers in order to distinguish “new”<br />from “old” professional work in larger economized fields of power.</p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p>Несмотря на то, что сам Бурдье не интересовался проблематикой профессий, его теория превосходно подходит для изучения последних изменений в этой области. Имеются в виду столкновения менеджеров и профессионалов, при постоянной профессионализации (причем, во вполне классическом смысле) первых.</p> <p>Очень редуцированное определение профессии: Traditionally, professions can be seen as groups of workers who control<br />themselves (e.g. Freidson 1994, 2001).</p> <p>In the sea of seemingly self-interested economic exchanges (Bourdieu<br />2000:19), professions are islands of cultural and social exchange that<br />materialize social services, guard expertise and craftsmanship, symbolize<br />the “goodness” of service provision, and generate material awards for the<br />professional workers concerned.</p> <p>The medical profession, lawyers, engineers and university professors represent<br />“pure professionalism” (cf. Noordegraaf 2007).</p> <p>Все внеэкономические претензии профессионалов определяются как иллюзио, а профессионализм - это символический капиталл, который необходимо постоянно поддерживать.</p> <p>То есть, профессионал это работник, который не только знает свое дело, но и умеет придать ему сверхзначимость. Так, некоторые авторы определяют профессию через техническую и этическую составляющие (Виленски, Бринт)</p> <p>Профессии сильно структурированы, поскольку являются формой коллективной организации (Бринт). Кроме того, они изолированы и защищены от общества.</p> <p>Интересный термин для обозначения веберианской и критической традиции в социологии профессий - power-centered^</p> <p>Professions become strong<br />when they offer “marketable expertise” (cf. Brint 1994:23) and build strong positions in work “ecologies” by establishing strong “jurisdictions”<br />(Abbott 1988)</p> <p>+ системное объяснение через институты, которые поддерживают профессии. + стратегическое объяснение, черз дискурсы, символы и стандарты, которые должны использовать профессионалы для поддержания своего статуса (Watson 2002; Fournier 1999)<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> and to enact the “appearance of professionalism”</span><br />(e.g. Hodgson 2002, 2005).</p> <p>По его мнению, именно теории конфликта подготовили почву для того, чтобы можно было говорить о профессионалзиации других видов деятельности.</p> <p>С функционалистской точки зрения, ни разу они не профессионалы, но Professionalism is socially constructed,<br />never pure and always “hybrid,” sometimes to a high extent (see<br />Noordegraaf 2007; compare Reed and Anthony 1992).</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Интересный способ оформления ссылки</span> see<br />Noordegraaf 2007; compare Reed and Anthony 1992).</p> <p>Within a profession, the professional is<br />not only educated in a technical sense. He or she is also socialized into a<br />group as a member and really “becomes” a professional in an embodied<br />sense. Over time he or she will develop a socially constituted capacity to<br />act and acquire a professional habitus, a set of dispositions that influences<br />how he or she perceives, thinks and acts</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WFV7REJX\v10n1_s4.pdf","","Социология профессий; Будущее профессий","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sociology, compared to<br />some other social sciences, has not been as quick to adopt this form of data collection.<br />Therefore, in this paper I overview the basics of Mechanical Turk research and suggest<br />its pros and cons, both in general and in relation to different sociological data-collection<br />methods and research needs. While Mechanical Turk is currently the most popular<br />crowdsourcing website for research, I present general concepts, patterns, and suggestions<br />that can be applied beyond Mechanical Turk to other crowdsourcing and online<br />research.</p>; <p>Конспект</p> <p>Crowdsourcing, a combination of crowd and outsourcing, simply means to outsource a<br />task or problem to other people. This can be as simple as asking a group of friends to<br />each make one square of a quilt for a gift...</p> <p>The name Mechanical Turk comes from the late 18th century Austrian Automaton Chess-player, a mechanical device that was</p> <ul> <li>dressed like a Turk. It was purported to be intelligent enough to play excellent chess;<br />however its chess playing was in fact controlled by an unseen human.</li> </ul> <p>Crowdsourcing problems to groups<br />of people is often most effective when larger problems (e.g., transcribing an archive)<br />can be divided into smaller tasks (e.g., transcribing a couple of pages) leading to the<br />alternative names of microtasking or microwork for this type of problem-solving<br />arrangement. Common tasks available on mturk include transcription, translation,<br />photo and video tagging as well as marketing and academic research.</p> <p><strong>Here is how mturk works:</strong> <strong>Requesters</strong> have some task which they are willing to pay<br />to have others complete. They set up their task on mturk.com either by using mturk’s<br />built-in tools, such as categorization, surveys, transcription from audio visual, or<br />transcription from an image tasks, or by linking to another website which contains<br />their task<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> (Fig. 1)</span>. The mturk requesters include a description of the task, qualifications<br />(if any) required of the workers, a time limit for completing the task, and the payment<br />amount for the task. Then the requesters launch batches with a certain number of HITs<br />(Human Interaction Tasks), the particular number of times they need that task completed.<br />If they decide they need more or different versions, they launch additional<br />batches.<br />After logging in, <strong>mturk workers</strong> can search and select among all requesters’ HITs<br />they desire and are qualified to do <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">(Fig. 2).</span> When they accept a HIT, they must<br />complete and submit it within a certain amount of time or return it if they choose not<br />to complete it. Requesters can accept (pay) or reject (not pay) for the submitted work,<br />and additionally they can give bonus payments for excellent work. Requesters have<br />names and workers have ids, meaning each can identify the other even without<br />knowing their identity. If a worker does poorly, he or she can be rejected for a given<br />task, or even blocked from completing future tasks by that requester.</p> <p><em>(see Mason and Suri 2012 for more<br />details of mturk’s capabilities and process).</em></p> <p><em></em><strong>Популяция МТУРКА</strong>Studies of the US mturk population consistently find that mturk workers are<br />younger, female, more liberal (Berinsky et al. 2012), and more educated (Paolacci<br />et al. 2010) than the general US population.&nbsp;<em>И много других очень полезных замечаний. Пропущено, но прочитано.&nbsp;</em>Интересный момент:&nbsp;one study found that only<br />13.4 % of workers report mturk as a primary source of income (Paolacci et al. 2010).</p> <p>Специальные исследования показывают, что работники МТУРКА справляются с большинством классических тестов на том же уровне, что и оффлайновые выборки.</p> <p>Возможность искажения множественных аккаунтов и др.

Более того, анонимизация там существует изначально. Это и хорошо, с точки зрения этики, но и создает проблемы - например, если надо исследовать национальные меньшинства.</em></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;Специфика опросов на МТУРКе</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>(see Berinsky et al. 2012 for a comparison of mturk surveys with<br />Am Soc<br />nationally representative and other surveys), although with some weighting or<br />matching adjustments it is a possibility (Mason and Suri 2012).</p> <p>mturk has built in tools to<br />design surveys.

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit.

We argue that the increasingly computational nature of social science is beginning to reverse this traditional bias against prediction; however, it has also highlighted three important issues that require resolution. First, current practices for evaluating predictions must be better standardized. Second, theoretical limits to predictive accuracy in complex social systems must be better characterized, thereby setting expectations for what can be predicted or explained. Third, predictive accuracy and interpretability must be recognized as complements, not substitutes, when evaluating explanations.

Smith). the data are normally distributed, with homogeneity of variance, and that they are independent of one another (e.g. not autocorrelated)(Vittinghoff et al., 2005). Furthermore,the predictor variables should be numerical, although indicator variables can be used in order to include nominal variables (e.g., binary coding to represent male and female). The violation of the assumption of normality can sometimes be redressed using data transformation, which may also correct heterogeneity of variance, but other issues such as autocorrelation are not easily dealt with and may require methods such as time series regression (Ryan, 2009).</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу того, как выбираются значения для ветвления дерева при интервальной зависимой переменной:</span></p> <p>l. By contrast with linear regression, no assumptions are made about the distribution of the data.

Unlike linear regression, interactions between different predictor variables are automatically incorporated into the regression tree model and variable selection is unnecessary because irrelevant predictors are excluded from the model. This makes complex, non-linear interactions between variables easier to accommodate than in linear regression modelling (Hastie et al., 2009). Breiman et al. (1984) extended the concept of regression trees by exploiting the power of computers to simultaneously generate hundreds of regression trees, known as ‘random forests’, which were based on a random selection of a subset of data from the training set.

Environmental samples were collected monthly from locations within the mixed farm over 14 months and were analyzed for Listeria spp. Meteorological factors were evaluated for their association with the presence of Listeria spp. by using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). The developed LR model identified wind speed and precipitation as significant risk factors (p < 0.05), indicating higher wind speed at day 2 prior to sampling and higher average precipitation over the previous 25 days before sampling increased the probability of isolation of Listeria spp. from the mixed farm. Results from RF revealed that average wind speed at day 2 prior to sampling and average precipitation in the previous 25 days before sampling were the most important factors influencing the presence of Listeria spp., which supported the findings from LR. These findings indicate that the occurrence of Listeria spp. was influenced by wind speed and precipitation, suggesting run-off and wind-driven dust might be possible routes of pathogen transmission in mixed farms. The developed LR and RF models, with robust predictive performances as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, can be used to predict Listeria spp. contamination risk in a mixed farm under different weather conditions and can help with the evaluation of farm management practices and the development of control strategies aimed at reducing pre-harvest microbial contamination in a mixed farming system.","2017-09-01","2018-01-04 19:29:02","2018-01-12 17:53:51","","","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hao_Pang4/publication/319672492_Identifying_and_modeling_meteorological_risk_factors_associated_with_pre-harvest_contamination_of_Listeria_species_in_a_mixed_produce_and_dairy_farm/links/5a00c08aaca2725286df9fb4/Identifying-and-modeling-meteorological-risk-factors-associated-with-pre-harvest-contamination-of-Listeria-species-in-a-mixed-produce-and-dairy-farm.pdf","рф; едарф","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The last few years have seen a rich discussion on the reliability and validity of psychological science and whether our experimental findings can falsify our existing theoretical models. Yet, concerns have also arisen that this movement may impede new theoretical developments. In this article, we re- analyze the data from a crowdsourced replication project that concluded that lab site did not matter as predictor for Stroop performance, and, therefore, that there were no “hidden moderators” (i.e., context was likely to matter little in predicting the outcome of the Stroop task). The authors challenge this conclusion via a new analytical method– supervised machine learning - that “allows the data to speak.” The authors apply this approach to the results from a Stroop task to illustrate the utility of machine learning and to propose moderators for future (confirmatory) testing. The authors discuss differences with some conclusions of the original article, which variables need to be controlled for in future inhibitory control tasks, and why psychologists can use machine learning to find surprising, yet solid, results in their own data.","2017-06-29","2017-11-16 13:30:03","2018-01-12 17:53:25","2017-11-16 13:30:03","","","","","","","What Predicts Stroop Performance?","","","","","","","","","","","","psyarxiv.com","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\992G6PJK\IJzerman et al. - 2017 - What Predicts Stroop Performance A Conditional Ra.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\6WSGURUX\scpe2.html","","рф; едарф","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"EEYQ38KI","book","2012","Marres, Noortje; Weltevrede, Esther","Scraping the Social: Issues in Live Research","","","","","","This paper investigates the device of scraping, a technique for the automated capture of online data, and its application in social research. We ask how this ‘medium-specific’ technique for data collection may be rendered analytically productive for social research. We argue that, as a technique that is currently being imported into social research, scraping has the capacity to restructure research in at least two ways. Firstly, as a technique that is not native to social research, scraping risks introducing ‘alien’ analytic assumptions such as a pre-occupation with freshness. Secondly, to scrape is to risk importing into our inquiry categories that are prevalent in the social practices and devices enabled by online media: scraping makes available already formatted data for social research. Scraped data, and online social data more generally, tend to come with analytics already built in. The pre-ordered nature of captured online data is often approached as a ‘problem’, but we propose it may be turned into a virtue, insofar as data formats that have currency in the practices under scrutiny may serve as a source of social data themselves. Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of social research analytically productive. It enables a form of ‘live’ social research, in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of social research. We demonstrate this point in an exercise of online issue profiling, and more particularly, by relying on Twitter and Google to track the issues of ‘austerity’ and ‘crisis’ over time. Here we distinguish between two forms of real-time research, those dedicated to monitoring live content (which terms are current?) and those concerned with analysing the liveliness of issues (which topics are happening?).","2012-01-01","2018-01-12 17:41:07","2018-01-12 17:52:19","","","","","","","","Scraping the Social","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","<p>Конспект</p> <p>Судя по заглавию, полагаются они, в основном, на готовые аналитические инструменты (гугл трендз и др).

We then show that, in this market, network-based measures of human capital provide additional insight into wages beyond traditional measures. In particular, we show that workers with diverse skills earn higher wages than those with more specialized skills. Moreover, we can distinguish between two different types of workers benefiting from skill diversity: jacks-of-all-trades, whose skills can be applied independently on a wide range of jobs, and synergistic workers, whose skills are useful in combination and fill a hole in the labor market.

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power.

There are benefits to using BNs compared to other unsupervised machine learning techniques. A few of these benefits are:</div><ol><li>It is easy to exploit expert knowledge in BN models.&nbsp;</li><li>BN models have been found to be very robust in the sense of i) noisy data, ii) missing data and iii) sparse data.&nbsp;</li><li>Unlike many machine learning models (including Artificial Neural Network), which usually appear as a &ldquo;black box,&rdquo; all the parameters in BNs have an understandable semantic interpretation.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>This post is the first in a series of &ldquo;Bayesian networks in R .&rdquo; The goal is to study BNs and different available algorithms for building and training, to query a BN and examine how we can use those algorithms in R programming.</div><div>The R famous package for BNs is called ""<span>bnlearn""</span>. This package contains different algorithms for BN structure learning, parameter learning and inference. In this introduction, we use one of the existing datasets in the package and show how to build a BN, train it and make an inference.</div><div><br></div>First let's load the ""<span>coronary""</span> dataset.<br><pre><br>data(coronary)<br></pre>This data contains the following information:<br><ul><li><span><i>Smoking</i></span> (smoking): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.</li><li><span><i>M.

"CYSPPCZN","encyclopediaArticle","2017","","Bayesian network","Wikipedia","","","","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bayesian_network&oldid=797952378","A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Formally, Bayesian networks are DAGs whose nodes represent random variables in the Bayesian sense: they may be observable quantities, latent variables, unknown parameters or hypotheses. Edges represent conditional dependencies; nodes that are not connected (there is no path from one of the variables to the other in the Bayesian network) represent variables that are conditionally independent of each other. Each node is associated with a probability function that takes, as input, a particular set of values for the node's parent variables, and gives (as output) the probability (or probability distribution, if applicable) of the variable represented by the node. For example, if                         m                 {\displaystyle m}    parent nodes represent                         m                 {\displaystyle m}    Boolean variables then the probability function could be represented by a table of                                    2                        m                                     {\displaystyle 2^{m}}    entries, one entry for each of the                                    2                        m                                     {\displaystyle 2^{m}}    possible combinations of its parents being true or false. Similar ideas may be applied to undirected, and possibly cyclic, graphs; such as Markov networks. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning in Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables (e.g. speech signals or protein sequences) are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.","2017-08-30","2017-10-23 09:52:02","2018-01-12 17:44:44","2017-10-23 09:52:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 797952378","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IXXHLKGV\index.html","","байесовы сети","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

На каждом шаге очередной узел дерева делится на два подузла. Для деления узла на два используется та переменная и то ее пороговое значение, которые обеспечи- вают максимальное падение индекса Джини, ...</p> <p>Объяснение механизма работы случайных лесов и деревьев принятия решений отвратительное. Без ссылок, без нифига, и так, что ничего не понятно. Не знаю, как сделать. Но что-то в таком духе я могу накатать, тупо сделав перевод какой-нибудь толковой статьи.</p> <p>Вообще не написал по элемент случайной выборки не только предикторов, но и наблюдений для них.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ага, вот и ответ на вопрос, которым я долго мучился, про оуверсэмпл: </span></p> <p>Отметим, что эти семь моделей оцениваются отдельно для каждой из четырех от- раслей по двум видам выборок, балансированной и небалансированной. Балансированной мы называем выборку, в которой равное количество активных предприятий и предприятий банкротов. Для балансировки выборки мы отбираем все де- фолтные предприятия (так как их меньше, чем активных) и равное количество активных предприятий, выбираемых из данной отрасли случайным образом. В небалансированную выборку мы также включаем все дефолтные предприятия и 20% всех активных предприятий из данной отрасли, отобранных случайным образом.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу нарушения предпосылок методов:</span></p> <p>Три метода дискриминантного анализа предполагают, что регрессоры имеют многомерное нормальное распределение (или смесь многомерных нормальных), поэтому использование факторных переменных в качестве регрессоров явно нарушает предпосылки этих методов. Поэтому расширенные версии формул, включающие дамми- переменные, анализировались с помощью четырех алгоритмов (классификационные де- ревья, алгоритм случайного леса, логит- и пробит-модели), а базовые версии формул ана- лизировались с помощью всех семи алгоритмов. Таким образом, всего было оценено 66 моделей. </p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу модального прогноза, очень хорошо сказано:</span></p> <p>Самый простой критерий качества, т.е. количество верно классифицированных предприятий, к сожалению, не пригоден. Действительно, при таком критерии качества даже самая тривиальная модель «все предприятия в следующем году будут активными» получит очень высокую оценку, ведь доля верно угаданных статусов предприятий ока- жется примерно 0,99. </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ох, а рок-анализ стоит освоить. Слишком уж часто он применяется, а я ни в зуб ногой...</span></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Вывод по поводу наилучшей модели для решения поставленной задачи:</span></p> <p>вне зависимости от отрасли наилучшим методом является алгоритм случайного леса. У него наибольшие медианные значения площади под ROC-кривой, все либо равны, либо близки к 0,7, что считается высоким показателем прогнозной силы. Во всех случаях не только медиана, но и весь диапазон значений площади для этого метода лежит выше максимальных значе- ний для остальных методов. Это говорит о нелинейной и неаддитивной зависимости между вероятностью стать банкротом и объясняющими переменными.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Метод оценки влияния переменных в модели случайного леса</span></p> <p>Важность конкретной переменной определяется (усредненным по всем деревьям) суммарным падением индекса Джини по всем узлам, относящимся к данной переменной.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Использован метод для интерпретации влияния включенных в модель переменных:</span></p> <p>К сожалению, визуализировать зависимость, обнаруженную алгоритмом случайно- го леса, крайне сложно. Случайный лес состоит из 500 деревьев, каждое дерево строится по своей подвыборке, при каждом делении узла используется свой набор объясняющих переменных. Мы наглядно демонстрируем направление связи между регрессорами и ве- роятностью дефолта с помощью двух подходов: предельных эффектов в логит-моделях и урезанных классификационных деревьев. </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Вывод и ограничения случайных лесов:</span></p> <p> В целом, существенно нелинейные алгоритмы показывают лучшие результаты. Поэтому нам представляется перспективным включе- ние в сравнение других нелинейных алгоритмов: нейронных сетей, метода опорных век- торов и бустинга. К сожалению, нелинейные алгоритмы, как правило, представляют со- бой «черный ящик», который дает возможность достаточно хорошо прогнозировать, но не позволяет наглядно описать зависимость. </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\58HHY5I7\Демешев.pdf","","рф; машинное обучение","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Может ли социология внести вклад в извлечение нового знания из этих массивов информации или же социологам следует оставаться в рамках традиционных для их науки методов сбора информации (преимущественно опро- сы, интервью, анализ агрегированной статистики), а работой с новыми массивами долж- ны заниматься специалисты из новых областей, смежных big data (так называемые data scientists)? Если ответ на первый вопрос положителен, то возникает вопрос 2. Как долж- ны трансформироваться методы и приемы социологического исследования или анализа в связи с тем, что социология сталкивается с принципиально новыми типами данных?</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Социологи о big data</span></p> <p>Цитата из Китчина здесь.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ссылка на одну из первых рефлексий по большим данным</span></p> <p>Базы данных, отвечающие этим требованиям, начали собираться с начала двух- тысячных годов во многих отраслях человеческой деятельности и тогда же стали осо- знаваться как принципиально новое явление (см., например, [Laney, 2001]).</p> <p>добными характеристиками базы данных стали неотъемлемой частью нашей жизни. Главной их особенностью был и остается факт, что первоначальная цель их сбора никак или почти никак не связана с последующим анализом – это данные, собираемые в базы для последующего извлечения сведений об уникальном событии.</p> <p><em>Вообще-то нет. У нас данные сайтов, которые работают для обслуживания посетителей.</em></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу эпистемологии больших данных</span></p> <p>Эта ситуация заставляет говорить о том, что происходит принципиальный эпи- стемологический сдвиг [Kitchin, 2014]. Следуя за идеями Дж. Грея, одного из ученых в сфере компьютерных наук, Китчин говорит о том, что прошлая (нынешняя) модель, которая именуется “вычислительной” (computational) наукой, опиралась на комплекс- ное моделирование сложных явлений, однако в основе ее лежали выборочные или агрегированные данные. При этом сама модель – гипотетический набор параметров, о которых нужно собрать информацию, в эту модель включаемую, – всегда шла впере- ди процесса сбора данных. Новая же парадигма, которая именуется “исследователь- ской” (exploratory) наукой, опирается в первую очередь на существующие массивы данных и учится задавать вопросы имеющимся данным, а не формировать запрос на сбор данных.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу перспективы того, что данные откроются в ближайшем будущем:</span></p> <p>на данный момент существует серьезная ориентация на формирование внутри организаций собственных аналитических структур, которые монополизируют доступ к данным. Но есть основания полагать, что необходимость внешней валида- ции исследовательских результатов в обозримом будущем заставит компании чаще предоставлять данные внештатным исследователям или публиковать их в открытом доступе.</p> <p><em>Вот это совсем неправда, и именно поэтому нам нужен парсинг. Кажется, авторы забывают о том, что в челленджах такого рода выполняется поставленная владельцем данных задача и предоставляемые данные часто форматируются соответствующим образом. И уж точно не предоставят данные, которые могли бы им навредить.</em></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Но поправляются в следующем абзаце:</span></p> <p> Набирающее силу движение за открытость данных, собираемых государственны- ми органами [World Bank, 2014], и наличие алгоритмов, позволяющих собирать и агре- гировать данные, например, об активности пользователей социальных сетей, делают массивы, собираемые корпорациями, не единственным источником знания.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Особенности анализа больших данных</span></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Про дата майнинг</span></p> <p>Во-первых, возникает необходимость в техниках анализа, ориентированных на большие, а не выборочные массивы – требуются отсутствующие сейчас в широкой практике инструменты оценки надежности связей, позволяющие исключить случай- ные зависимости, неизбежно возникающие при применении традиционных подходов к анализу массива из миллионов записей.</p> <p>Кроме того, перечисляет сложности:</p> <p>1. Технологии подготовки к анализу - прикладное программирование</p> <p>2. Анонимизация</p> <p>3. Вычислительные мощности</p> <p>4. Однако ключевой проблемой “больших данных” является их смысл и интерпре- тация. Как собрана информация? Как проводилась фиксация? Какие ошибки инстру- мент измерения вносит в данные? В обычном исследовании ученый если не полностью контролирует эту стадию, то хотя бы имеет представления о том, что происходит в момент сбора или измерения данных. В случае с Big Data исследователь не только лишен возможности влиять на инструмент, но и нередко не может наблюдать его в действии. </p> <p>С последним мы активно боремся - смотрим конкурсы, сверяем значения разных переменных, sanity-check. Действительно, можно расписать, что именно мы делаем на этом этапе.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MSMFPB9F\6015.html","","беде","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place.

In this talk I highlight some examples of research that would not have been possible just a handful of years ago and that illustrate the promise of CSS. At the same time, they illustrate its limitations. I then conclude with some thoughts on how CSS can bridge the gap between its current state and its potential.

Thompson flies with the angels—Hell’s Angels, that is—in this short work of nonfiction.   “California, Labor Day weekend . . . early, with ocean fog still in the streets, outlaw motorcyclists wearing chains, shades and greasy Levis roll out from damp garages, all-night diners and cast-off one-night pads in Frisco, Hollywood, Berdoo and East Oakland, heading for the Monterey peninsula, north of Big Sur. . . The Menace is loose again.”   Thus begins Hunter S. Thompson’s vivid account of his experiences with California’s most notorious motorcycle gang, the Hell’s Angels. In the mid-1960s, Thompson spent almost two years living with the controversial Angels, cycling up and down the coast, reveling in the anarchic spirit of their clan, and, as befits their name, raising hell. His book successfully captures a singular moment in American history, when the biker lifestyle was first defined, and when such countercultural movements were electrifying and horrifying America. Thompson, the creator of Gonzo journalism, writes with his usual bravado, energy, and brutal honesty, and with a nuanced and incisive eye; as The New Yorker pointed out, “For all its uninhibited and sardonic humor, Thompson’s book is a thoughtful piece of work.” As illuminating now as when originally published in 1967, Hell’s Angels is a gripping portrait, and the best account we have of the truth behind an American legend.From the Hardcover edition.","2012-08-01","2017-12-14 12:07:39","2017-12-14 12:07:39","","","279","","","","","Hell's Angels","","","","","Random House Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 84o2ZGPzEVEC","","; D:\Dropbox\literature\Random House Publishing Group2012\Thompson_2012_Hell's Angels.pdf","https://books.google.ru/books?id=84o2ZGPzEVEC","","Social Science / Folklore & Mythology; Social Science / Men's Studies; Social Science / Popular Culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And how does this association vary depending on contextual differences? To answer this question, our study uses an additive Bayesian Networks model to explain the interrelationships between health and socioeconomic determinants using complex and messy data.

В более широком смысле идеологии – это представления<br />и ценности, убеждения и идеалы, в которых выражаются и консти-<br />туируются интересы социальных групп. Эти взгляды на цели и спо-<br />собы развития общества, с одной стороны, служат символическим<br />клеем, объединяя людей в группы, партии, ассоциации, а с другой<br />стороны, воздвигают барьеры между представителями одного соци-<br />ального класса, одной и той же организации. Даже члены одной се-<br />мьи могут занимать разные идеологические позиции. В них люди<br />черпают формулы для объяснения тех или иных ситуаций, опреде-<br />ления своих задач и находят оправдание своих действий, стремясь<br />сохранить или переустроить сложившийся социальный порядок.<br />Профессионалы, эксперты, пользуясь уважением и доверием со<br />стороны общества, включаются в публичные дебаты, внося вклад в<br />определение тех или иных ситуаций как проблематичных и тре-бующих интервенции со стороны знающих и умелых специалистов.В этой статье мы обсудим основные подходы к исследованию про-<br />фессионализма как идеологии, рассмотрим некоторые типы профес-<br />сиональных идеологий, или мифов и отдельно остановимся на том,<br />как связаны между собой ценности профессиональных групп с<br />дискурсами государства благосостояния.</pre> <pre>Джулия Эветтс выделяет два взгляда на идеологию профессио-<br />нализма – во-первых, как на нормативную ценностную систему, не-<br />обходимую для сплоченности и стабильности, и, во-вторых, как на<br />систему аргументов, направленных на оправдание власти и домини-<br />рования профессионалов [Evetts, 2003; см. также Эветтс, 2009].</pre> <pre>Действительно неплохой обзор идеологий в функционализме и теориях конфликта.<br />Ну а тенденция современности:<br />Общественные движе-<br />ния, объединения, группы потребителей, клиентов и пациентов<br />складываются вокруг этих приоритетов и ценностей, развиваются и<br />ширятся подчас независимо от желания и способности доминирую-<br />щих политических групп считаться с чьим-то мнением. Профессио-<br />налы вынуждены трансформировать свою идеологию, повышать<br />открытость и гибкость, включая своих клиентов в процессы обмена<br />информацией и принятия решений.<br />Миф профессионализации является производным от мифа о технократии. Согласно мифу о технократии, применение новых знаний и<br />технологий является главным фактором модернизации, при этом<br />общество управляется при помощи объективного знания интеллек-<br />туальной элиты<br /><br /><em>Профессионализм, с одной стороны, пред-<br />полагает высокую степень техничности и рутинизации действий,<br />чтобы знание возможно было передавать посредством обучения. С<br />другой стороны, профессиональные процедуры не должны быть<br />полностью предсказуемы – иначе клиенты смогут оценить степень<br />сложности задачи и даже выполнить ее сами. Профессиональное<br />знание должно быть в достаточной степени сложным, эзотериче-<br />ским, «скрытым знанием» (tacit knowledge).<br /><br />Миф об альтруизме профессионалов во многом поддерживался<br />теоретическими идеями Парсонса, согласно которому институци-<br />альные условия «свободных профессий», в отличие от бизнеса, ог-<br />раничивают «агрессивность эгоистического интереса» Йето дискредитируется сведениями о нарушениях профессионалами всех и всяческих моральных и др. норм. <br /></em><br />Представления о том, что деятельность профессионалов кон-<br />тролируется изнутри, со стороны таких же компетентных коллег,<br />объединенных в ассоциацию, основаны на мифе об автономии и<br />рациональности профессий.<br />Эта тоже на Бурдье эпизодически ссылается, хотя и не так основательно, как НУрдеграф.<br /><br />Перефразируя Миллса, определение профессионалов<br />как группы людей, обладающих высокими нравственными качест-<br />вами, есть идеологические оружие привилегированной прослойки,<br />независимо от того, создана ли эта идеология самими профессио-<br />налами, или создана для них другими [Миллс, 2007. С. 31-32].<br /><br />В тече-<br />ние ХХ века социальное государство полностью оформилось на<br />основе новых технологий воспитания детей, семьи и представле-<br />ний населения о правильном и неправильном поведении, само-<br />определении, о нормальности и ненормальности, за функционированием которых стояли разнообразные группы специалистов,<br />обладавших властью знания.<br /><br /><strong>Классификация социальных государств:<br /></strong>Напомним, в связи с этим, известную классификацию совре-<br />менных режимов государств благосостояния, разработанную Г. Эс-<br />пинг-Андерсеном [Esping-Andersen, 1990] в 1980-е годы, различаю-<br />щая либеральный, социал-демократический и консервативный ти-<br />пы социальных государств в зависимости от их идеологических ос-<br />нов, масштабов социальных гарантий, размеров социальных посо-<br />бий и других критериев. Классификация режимов основана на вы-<br />делении ключевого социального института (государства, рынка или<br />семьи), несущего ответственность за обеспечение благосостояния<br />населения, а также структуры и масштабов социальной помощи.</pre>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building upon the ideas set out in The Consequences of Modernity, Giddens argues that 'high' or 'late' modernity is a post traditional order characterised by a developed institutional reflexivity. In the current period, the globalising tendencies of modern institutions are accompanied by a transformation of day-to-day social life having profound implications for personal activities. The self becomes a 'reflexive project', sustained through a revisable narrative of self identity. The reflexive project of the self, the author seeks to show, is a form of control or mastery which parallels the overall orientation of modern institutions towards 'colonising the future'. Yet it also helps promote tendencies which place that orientation radically in question - and which provide the substance of a new political agenda for late modernity. In this book Giddens concerns himself with themes he has often been accused of unduly neglecting, including especially the psychology of self and self-identity. The volumes are a decisive step in the development of his thinking, and will be essential reading for students and professionals in the areas of social and political theory, sociology, human geography and social psychology.","2013-04-30","2017-05-22 05:20:42","2017-05-22 05:20:42","","","270","","","","","Modernity and Self-Identity","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JFY4JXYNSBQC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=JFY4JXYNSBQC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Существует<br />ряд теоретических конструкций, выстроенных на фундаменте идей<br />«объект-центричной социальности» (К. Кнорр-Цетина) и «интеробъ-<br />ективности» (Б. Латур)</p> <p>Сегодня «поворот к материальному» служит<br />удобным именованием для особого стиля социологического теорети-<br />зирования, в фокусе которого находится проблематика вещности со-<br />циального мира.</p> <p>Дискуссия о роли материальных объектов в конституировании со-<br />циальной реальности стимулируется развитием дисциплины «Наука,<br />Техника и Общество» („Science, Technology and Society“, sts).25 Именно<br />в ней проблема «материального в социальном» и «социального в ма-<br />териальном» была переведена в плоскость эмпирических исследо-<br />ваний.</p> <p>все участники sts согласны относительно следующего: об-<br />щественные науки должны выйти за пределы той сферы, которая до на-<br />стоящего времени считалась сферой „общественного“».</p> <p>На смену социальному конструктивизму в ра-<br />ботах Латура приходит конструктивизм, который можно назвать «ре-<br />ципрокным»: материальное и социальное находятся в процессе непре-<br />рывного взаимного конструирования.</p> <p>Если сторонники таких насле-<br />дующих Гофману направлений как когнитивная социология (Э. Зеру-<br />бавель) и конверсативный анализ (Э. Щеглофф, Х. Сакс) акцентируют<br />нематериальность фрейма, его укорененность в структурах коммуни-<br />кации40 и когнитивных схемах41, то для акторно-сетевого подхода зна-<br />чимы именно вещные, материальные ограничения интеракции. Та-<br />ким образом, «framework» по Латуру — это вся совокупность «редук-<br />торов социального взаимодействия», фрагментирующих и делающих<br />его парциальным, это обобщенная характеристика всех локализующих<br />его ограничений.</p> <p> </p> <p>Взаимодействие людей не ограничивается их телами, которые сопри-<br />сутствуют в одном времени и пространстве, связанные взаимным вни-<br />манием и общей деятельностью; для понимания человеческого взаи-<br />модействия приходится обращаться к другим элементам, другому вре-<br />мени, другим местам и другим акторам».42 Иными словами, помимо<br />локализующих характеристик, у социального взаимодействия есть ха-<br />рактеристики «глобализующие», распространяющие, делающие его<br />повсеместным.</p> <p>Если «фрейм» — это «редуктор интеракции», то «сеть » — ее «дист-<br />рибьютор». Так в латуровской социологии понятие «framework» до-<br />полняется понятием «network». «Взаимодействие, — пишет Латур, —<br />выражается в противоречивых формах: оно представляет собой сис-<br />тему фреймов (которая ограничивает интеракцию) и сеть (которая<br />распределяет одновременность, близость и „персональность“ взаи-<br />модействий)»</p> <p>Для того чтобы фреймировать взаимодействие, необходимы пе-<br />регородки и укромные места. Но сами эти места связаны между со-<br />бой посредством объектов-медиаторов в гетерогенную сеть, которая<br />смешивает времена, пространства и актантов.</p> <p> </p> <p>Всякий раз, когда мы наклоняемся к переговорному устройству и пе-<br />редаем через узкую щель в стеклянной перегородке заказное письмо,<br />мы встраиваемся в глобальную сеть отношений и интеракций, выхо-<br />дящую далеко за пределы наличной ситуации действия, ограничен-<br />ной рамками определенного фрейма. Сети лишают социальное взаи-<br />модействие той определенности, которую сообщают ему фреймы — та-<br />ков вывод Латура.</p> <p>Ассоциация множества материальных и нематериальных элемен-<br />тов (монад) — это гибрид, приобретающий свои свойства не в силу из-<br />начальной целостности, а благодаря индивидуальности каждого ингре-<br />диента и их специфических отношений, конфигураций.</p> <p>у Латура и Каллона «сеть» — это социологическое понятие, характеристика глобализованного, распределенного в пространстве и времени взаимодействия, поделенного на дискретные агентности и опосредованного объектами.</p>; <p>Конспект по Гофману</p> <p>Деятельность, находящаяся в определенном фрейме, — особенно коллективно организованная социальная деятельность — часто выделяется из непрерывного потока окружающих событий специальным набором пограничных знаков, или некими условными скобками</p> <p>Во времени они могут проявляться до начала и после окончания деятельности, а в пространстве — устанавливать ее пределы, короче говоря, это пространственно-временные скобки.</p>; <p>Конспект по Карин Кнорр-Цетина. Социальность и объекты: социальные отношения в постсоциальных обществах знания</p> <p>нынешний разрыв связей между идентичностями сопровождается расширением объект-центричного окружения, в котором «Я» находит свое место и приобретает устойчивость. Это окружение определяет идентичность индивида точно так же, как прежде ее определяли общины и семьи</p> <p>Понятие «объектуализации» в своем крайнем варианте подразумевает, что объекты сменяют людей в роли посредников и партнеров по взаимодействию, что они все сильнее вмешиваются в человеческие взаимоотношения, из-за чего последние попадают в зависимость от них.</p> <p>Индивидуализация и ""отступление традиционных социальных принципов"" составляют постсоциальную сущность природы современности.</p> <p>Помимо краха общины и традиций, составляющего основу индивидуализации, в число текущих преобразований входят некоторые другие виды «отступления» социальных принципов.</p> <p>Социальные объяснения и социальное мышление противоречат, среди прочего, биологическим теориям о поведении человека, в борьбе с которыми они пытаются доказать свою истинность. Если Фрейд полагал, что исследовавшиеся им отклонения и нервные болезни вызваны неспособностью индивида прийти к согласию с суровым внутренним «цензором» — представителем общества (Lasch, 1978: 37), то современные психологи более склонны искать причину психических расстройств в наследственности.</p> <p>Подобные «постсоциальные» преобразования свидетельствуют о том, что известные нам социальные формы уплощаются, сужаются и истончаются; социальное отступает во всех описанных выше смыслах. <em>Разумеется, это дело можно приплести к собственному рассуждению - в том духе, что раз нет социальной поддержки режима, если больничные правила заканчиваются с соответствующими фреймами, то они и не соблюдаются. Вот если бы, скажем, комсомольская ячейка помогала поддерживать рекомендации врача - это было бы проявление сложной социальной структуры. А так - хуй. Нужно чем-то компенсировать. Давайте компенсировать гетерогенными общностями.</em></p> <p>Можно интерпретировать эту тенденцию как очередной импульс к индивидуализации: вполне допустимо предположить, что отныне именно индивиды, а не государство, будут нести ответственность за удовлетворение потребностей в социальном обеспечении и социальной безопасности, и что в обществе услуг именно с личностью, а не с крупномасштабными организациями, сильнее будут связываться средства производства и коммуникации. Такая интерпретация точно фиксирует положение дел: в современном обществе на подъеме находятся структуры, строящиеся вокруг личности, а не коллектива.</p> <p>Такому сценарию простой «десоциализации» мне хочется противопоставить следующее соображение: уплощение структур, отступление их организующих принципов, истончение социальных отношений происходят одновременно с развитием «других» культурных элементов и практик современной жизни, и в какой-то степени могут даже являться их следствием.</p> <p>Общество не лишается текстуры, хотя, возможно, следует пересмотреть вопрос о том, из чего эта текстура состоит.</p> <p>Здесь в роли чужеродной культуры, подразумевавшейся также во всех предшествовавших исследованиях индивидуализации, выступают знание и экспертиза.</p> <p><em>Да-да, активно ссылается на концепцию саморефлексивности Гидденса (90б94 года книги). </em></p> <p><em>Одно но по поводу Гидденса:</em></p> <p>Однако эти контексты по-прежнему рассматриваются как чужеродные элементы в социальной системе — элементы, с которыми лучше не связываться. Поэтому утверждается, что экспертные системы имеют отношение к технической стороне работы экспертов, но отличаются от принципов, проявляющихся в других сферах социальной жизни.</p> <p><em>В этом смысле, ""школы диабета"" - классические проявления экспертных систем, которые, однако, не претендуют на выстраивание постсоциальных связей, которые могли бы компенсировать деградацию сложных социальных структур.</em></p> <p><em>А вот:</em></p> <p>Основная проблема в отношении многих из упомянутых выше теорий состоит в том, что знание (или техника) считаются в них независимой переменной — иногда формулируемой так, чтобы соответствовать давним представлениям о науке</p> <p>Традиционное определение «общества знания» делает акцент на «знании», рассматриваемом как конкретный продукт. Определение, которое предлагаю я, перемещает акцент на «общество» — то общество, которое (если аргументация об экспансии экспертных систем верна) в настоящее время существует скорее внутри процессов познания, а не вне их.</p> <p>Определение социальности как исключительно вопроса человеческих отношений игнорирует взаимопереплетение культур знания и социальных структур</p> <p>индивидуализация переплетается с объектуализаций — со все большей ориентацией на объекты как на источники обретения своего «Я», близости, совместной субъектности и социальной интеграции.<br /><br /></p> <p>суть расширенного понимания социальности, включающей и материальные объекты (но не ограничивающейся ими) — мы назовем такую социальность объект-центричной</p> <p><strong><em>Что такое объект - объект экспертизы?</em></strong></p> <p>Вообще, есть товары, инструменты и объекты познания. Не особо интересно.</p> <p>Выше уже обсуждались две основные категории объектов, знакомые социологам и преобладающие в социальной жизни: товары и инструменты. Изучение процесса экспертизы в науке и вне науки позволяет выделить третью категорию — объект познания. Определяющей характеристикой объектов этого вида, с теоретической точки зрения, является их переменчивый, раскрывающийся характер — отсутствие «объект-ности» и завершенности существования, неидентичность с самими собой.</p> <p>Еще важно, что у эксперта формируется эмоциональная привязанность к объекту познания.

Chatterboxing is the act of watching a televised event such as the Super Bowl and using a second screen to engage with others, primarily in real time. Researchers have used communication theory as a framework for study of Twitter, considering both #hashtags and @mentions to be primarily communicative. To ascertain whether #hashtags may be fundamentally different and amenable to study as organizational conventions as well, we first compared differences between usage of #hashtags and @mentions during the Super Bowl by taking tweets from three locations identified as heavily invested in the event (hometowns of the teams and the location of the game: Boston, NYC, Indianapolis) and tweets from locations that were not invested (Dallas, Miami, Seattle). Non-parametric statistical comparisons were made between tweets from the three invested and non-invested groups to ascertain whether the uses of labeling conventions were identical. Next a qualitative analysis of a subset of non-location specific tweets supplied information about the content of tweets, the aboutness of #hashtags, and the placement of #hashtags in the tweets. Our findings indicate that #hashtags and @mentions do have two separate functions but that location has a positive influence on their statistical dependency. We also find that #hashtags are used as organizational mechanisms and can reflect aboutness. Specifically, #hashtags are used to describe in order to categorize and to retrieve in order to follow or join a conversation, and future studies should be able to use theories of organization of information to analyze these labels as a way of complementing their otherwise communicative nature.","2012","2016-12-18 13:20:58","2016-12-18 13:20:58","2016-12-18 13:20:58","1-11","","1","49","","Proc.

"KCKJ47S4","journalArticle","","King, Russell","Theories and Typologies of Migration: An Overview and a Primer","","","","","","Whilst the literature on international migration expands at a seemingly exponential rate, significant statements about the theorisation of migration are much less common; probably they are hindered by the increasing diversification of types of migration. This paper first reviews the various types of migration, and emphasises the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the study and theorisation of migration. In the main part of the paper I provide a personalised overview of theories of international migration, divided into the following sections: push-pull theory and the neoclassical approach; migration and development transitions; historical-structural and political economy models; the role of systems and networks; the ‘new economics’ of migration; and finally approaches based on the ‘transnational turn’ in migration studies. In the conclusion I point up some future challenges to theorising migration: the need to embed the study of migration within global processes of social, economic and political transformation and within the biographies of migrants’ lifecourses; the importance of also explaining why people do not migrate, and the notion of access to mobility as a differentiating factor of class and inequality; and the relevance of existential and emotional dimensions of migration. The paper is explicitly aimed at a student audience and is intended as a primer to understanding some of the complexities and challenges of theorising migration.","","2019-09-13 21:24:43","2019-09-13 21:24:43","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Stephen Castels has written on the age of migration a period during which international migration has accelerated, globalised, feminised, diversified and become increasingly politicised/ Writing from a different perspective John Urry has argued that the static or ‘sedentarist’ structures that traditionally defined western society – social class, static residence and stable employment – 5have been replaced by a new defining characteristic, mobility (Urry 2000, 2007).</p> <p> </p> <p>Numbers apart, migration is important because of the way it shapes and re-shapes societies, making them more diverse and complex.</p> <p> </p> <p>Other trajectories are also becoming evident: onward migration when a move from A to B is succeeded by a move to country C; and transit migration when migrants aiming to move from A to B spend substantial amounts of time moving through, or getting stuck in, one or more intervening countries. Morocco, Libya and Turkey have functioned as transit countries for sub-Saharan migrants aiming to enter Europe (see, e.g., Suter 2012).</p> <p> </p> <p>Summing up, three ‘core groups’ have dominated the study of migration in the past and still do so to some extent: temporary labour migrants, settler-migrants, and refugees.</p> <p>Samers (2010: 55-56) describes []Ravenstein's laws of migration as ‘economically deterministic’, ‘methodologically individualist’ and ‘dreadfully antiquated’</p> <p> </p> <p>Later on, the 'push-pull' framework had also been amended by a set of 'intervening obstacles' which have to be overcome.</p> <p>examples are physical distance, cost of making the journey, cultural barriers such as language and different ways of life, and political obstacles such as international borders and immigration restrictions. Personal factors also play a role in Lee’s theorisation of migration: different people will react differently to various combinations of pushes and pulls, according to their economic status, life-stage and personality. To give a typical example, a single, unemployed young adult will respond more directly to job and income factors and be less concerned about the education system of a destination, which would be more relevant to the decision-making of a family with children (Lee, 1966).</p> <p>Push-pull models dominated much migration thinking during the mid-twentieth century, until the 1960s if not later, and reflect the neoclassical economics paradigm, based on principles of utility maximisation, rational choice, factor-price differentials between regions and countries, and labour mobility.</p> <p>According to Arango (2004: 19-20), the Achilles heel of neoclassical theory was its failure to explain, first, why so few people actually migrate, despite the apparent incentives to do so; and second, why some countries have high rates of out-migration whilst others, with the same structural economic conditions, have very low rates.</p> <p>A systems approach has been widely hailed as a fruitful and comprehensive framework for studying migration, largely because of its multiple analytical focus on structure, linkage and process.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;""> ‘Gulf migration system’ and so on (Boyle et al. 1998: 77-79) - </span>An example of systems approach.</p> <p>According to Boyd and Nowak (2012: 79-83), there are three main types of migrant networks: family and personal networks, labour networks, and illegal migrant networks. These authors also highlight the gendered nature of all networks, and the often active role of women in developing and sustaining personal networks (2012: 83-86).</p> <p>Combining family decision-making with neoclassical orthodoxy, the so-called ‘new economics’ of migration has made a major impact on the theorisation of migration since the 1980s. Its leading exponent has been Oded Stark (see Stark 1991; for two landmark papers see Lucas and Stark 1985; Stark and Bloom 1985; and for an excellent review article, Taylor 1999).</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\D8VYI8P9\King - Theories and Typologies of Migration An Overview .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a structural model of user participation in crowdsourcing-contests and present empirical evidence on how incentive structure could affect the quality of solutions. Using data from Threadless.com, we find that participants exert less effort as competition for the reward increases. This indicates that increasing the reward may adversely affect the quality of the solutions produced as it will increase the competition. However, counter-intuitively the policy simulations indicate that increasing the reward increases both the quantity and quality of submitted solutions. This is because under the new policy of higher reward, individual equilibrium behavior is different. When the firm increases the reward, the additional utility from increase in the reward offsets the reduction in probability of winning due to intensified competition.","","2019-06-22 04:51:28","2019-06-22 04:51:28","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>The term Crowdsoursing-contest is used as opposed to the term ""open contest"" unb Chen et al.</p> <p> </p> <p>In a typical <strong>crowdsourcing contest</strong>, aninnovating firm (<strong>the seeker)</strong> facing a problem posts this problem to an open crowd(the solvers).Areward is provided to attract <strong>solvers</strong>.

Information Systems researchers have not been slow to embrace this combination of method and data. Such systems increasingly provide “digital trace data” that provide new research opportunities. Yet digital trace data are substantively different from the survey and interview data for which network analysis measures and interpretations were originally developed. This paper examines 10 validity issues associated with the combination of digital trace data and social network analysis methods, with examples from the IS literature, to provide recommendations for improving the validity of future research.","2011-12-29","2019-05-01 20:07:13","2019-06-04 07:12:38","","","","12","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Agarwal et al. (2008) put it thus: ""Most transactions and conversations in<br />these online groups leave a digital trace…this research data makes visible social processes that are<br />much more difficult to study in conventional organizational settings.""</p> <p>the underlying assumptions of traditional social network analysis methods have<br />not often been examined in detail when using digital trace data.</p> <p>We<br />define digital trace data as records of activity (trace data) undertaken through an online information<br />system (thus, digital). A trace is a mark left as a sign of passage; it is recorded evidence that<br />something has occurred in the past. For trace data, the system acts as a data collection tool,<br />providing both advantages and limitations. The task for using this evidence in network analysis is to<br />turn these recorded traces of activity into measures of theoretically interesting constructs.</p> <p>All trace data, not just digital trace data, has three characteristics that underlie many of the issues<br />discussed in this paper: 1) it is found data (rather than produced for research), 2) it is event-based<br />data (rather than summary data), and 3) as events occur over a period of time, it is longitudinal data.<br />In each aspect, such data contrasts with data traditionally collected through social network surveys<br />and interviews.</p> <p>First, trace data are found data in the sense that they are a by-product of activities rather than<br />produced by a designed research instrument. Wikipedia was not designed to test theories about<br />knowledge production, nor are corporate email systems designed to collect research data. This origin<br />contrasts with social network surveys or interviews that are specifically designed to produce data for<br />research. Trace data, as found data, must be adapted for research purposes.</p> <p>Second, trace data are event-based data, rather than summary-based data. In a traditional SNA<br />survey, researchers typically ask directly about social relationships, relying on the respondents to recall<br />and interpret their own interactions to summarize a social relationship. By contrast, with trace data,<br />researchers themselves must make the move from evidence to measure and from event to relationship.</p> <p>The final key characteristic of trace data are that they are longitudinal data, because the events that<br />make it up occur over time.</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\49NU2MFJ\2.html; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PYLECUYG\Howison и др. - 2011 - Validity Issues in the Use of Social Network Analy.pdf","","беде","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On that day, Facebook closed access to its Pages API, which had allowed researchers to extract all posts, comments, and associated metadata from public Facebook pages (Schroepfer, 2018). This decision followed the company’s April 2015 closure of its public search API, which provided searchable access to all public posts within a rolling two-week window (Facebook, n.d.). The closure of the Pages API eliminated all terms of service (TOS)-compliant access to Facebook content. Let me underscore the magnitude of this shift: there is currently no way to independently extract content from Facebook without violating its TOS.</p> <p>The specific implications for Facebook research are immense, but larger still are those for API-based research more generally. When companies can restrict or eliminate API access at any time, for any reason, and without any recourse, computational researchers and students need to seriously consider how to proceed. We find ourselves in a situation where heavy investment in teaching and learning platform-specific methods can be rendered useless overnight: this is what I mean by “the post-API age.”</p> <p>Researchers of social and other online media content should start by doing two things as they brace themselves for the uncertainty ahead. First, they should learn how to scrape the web; and second, they should understand the potential consequences of violating platforms’ TOS by doing so.</p> <p>Web scraping refers to the practice of automatically extracting content from web pages and other digital files. It predates API extraction by well over a decade, yet it has fallen somewhat out of favor as APIs have become easier to access. It is more flexible than API extraction because it can be used on most webpages, not just those that offer APIs. As a skill, therefore, it is more robust to the kind of obsolescence that befell my Facebook module</p> <p>In addition to the technical challenges it poses, web scraping also raises legal and ethical dimensions that API users seldom face. Automated, large-scale content extraction exerts a substantial bandwidth toll on target sites, which is why many of the web’s top platforms (including Facebook and Google) explicitly forbid it in their TOS. But this fact does not always prevent researchers from scraping data from such sites: while they typically attempt to automatically detect and block scraping, carefully-crafted software can circumvent such restrictions.</p> <p>Do not confuse TOS compliance with human subjects compliance or privacy protection. One of the most important purposes of research ethics is to protect research participants. The purpose of TOS is to protect the companies that create them. By employing TOS-compliant methods, you are respecting the business prerogatives of the company that created the platform you are studying, but you may or may not be respecting the dignity and privacy of the platform’s users.</p> <p>A recent lawsuit brought by four computational researchers challenges the government’s practice of prosecuting TOS violations but is still pending at the time of writing (Sandvig, 2017). Until it is resolved, researchers should bear in mind the potential (if unlikely) consequences of even small-scale TOS violations.</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7N8LLQAB\post_api_age_AV_20180820.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JMTFCY8H\10584609.2018.html; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RSTC3QBY\Freelon - 2018 - Computational Research in the Post-API Age.pdf","","беде","social media; Twitter; Facebook; API; computational","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider the question ‘what makes Big Data, Big Data?’, applying Kitchin’s taxonomy of seven Big Data traits to 26 datasets drawn from seven domains, each of which is considered in the literature to constitute Big Data. The results demonstrate that only a handful of datasets possess all seven traits, and some do not possess either volume and/or variety. Instead, there are multiple forms of Big Data.

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The sociocultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.","","2019-05-29 12:33:09","2019-05-29 12:42:18","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Here, any data from the web is also viewed as ""big data""</p> <p>While there are many social media platforms, big data research<br />focuses disproportionately on Twitter.</p> <p>More Facebook users (estimated to be more than<br />50%) have made their profiles “private”, i.e. not accessible<br />on the public Internet, as compared with Twitter users (estimated<br />as less than 10%).</p> <p>Twitter data also has a simple and clean structure.

It examines current thinking and perceptions on this topic among Western secret services and is based on an analysis of approximately 40 annual reports from 15 secret services in 11 Western countries, covering the period 2014–2018. This activity is by nature covert, and the analysis given in these reports from Western secret services complements other research and shows the broad range of tools and techniques employed for political inﬂuence, and much detail on the execution of these activities. According to these secret services, Russia is the foreign state that tries to inﬂuence European politics and decision-making most, and more so than China and other states. These inﬂuence activities support three main Russian strategic objectives: regime security, predominance in Russia’s near abroad, and world-power status for Russia. The longterm objective of Russian inﬂuence activities is to weaken NATO and the EU. In the shorter term, it is to lift the sanctions imposed after the Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014. Russia also has more speciﬁc objectives related to each individual country. Russia is targeting the West through a divide and rule approach, using multiple tools of inﬂuence. The population is mainly reached through media and social media, exploiting divisive issues. Minorities, refugees, and extremists are used to further this divide and rule approach. Human intelligence and cyber operations are important covert tools of inﬂuence. Russia also uses the energy sector, business, and corruption as venues for inﬂuence. It has an extensive network of allies and front organizations, and reconstructs reality and rewrites history to legitimize itself and undermine others. Finally, military force is Russia’s ultimate tool of inﬂuence. These inﬂuence activities are of large-scale, and the threat should be taken seriously, but the reports studied also indicate that the effects of these activities are limited.","2019-12","2019-05-29 05:08:04","2019-05-29 05:08:04","2019-05-29 05:08:04","19","","1","5","","Palgrave Commun","Divide and rule","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UD42KF56\Karlsen - 2019 - Divide and rule ten lessons about Russian politic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IP6DL926","encyclopediaArticle","2019","","Digital footprint","Wikipedia","","","","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_footprint&oldid=893588095","Digital footprint or digital shadow refers to one's unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions and communications manifested on the Internet or on digital devices. On the World Wide Web, the internet footprint; also known as cyber shadow, electronic footprint, or digital shadow, is the information left behind as a result of a user's web-browsing and stored as cookies. The term usually applies to an individual person, but can also refer to a business, organization and corporation.There are two main classifications for digital footprints: passive and active. A passive digital footprint is data collected without the owner knowing (also known as data exhaust), whereas active digital footprints are created when personal data is released deliberately by a user for the purpose of sharing information about oneself by means of websites or social media. Information may be intentionally or unintentionally left behind by the user; with it being either passively or actively collected by other interested parties. Depending on the amount of information left behind, it may be simple for other parties to gather large amounts of information on that individual using simple search engines.   Tony Fish expounded upon the possible dangers of digital footprints in a 2007 self-published book. The closed loop takes data from the open loop and provides this as a new data input. This new data determines what the user has reacted to, or how they have been influenced. The feedback then builds a digital footprint based on social data, and the controller of the social digital footprint data can determine how and why people purchase and behave. Katalin Fehér emphasized in her academic research paper about personal online strategies in 2017 that users leave digital footprints behind via online systems and new media.

This break involves a profound transformation that is both extensional and intensional. In terms of extensionality, globalising influences of interconnection span the globe, so that individuals now live in a global world; in terms of intensionality, the intimate and personal features of dayto-day existence become fundamentally altered. After reaffirming his view that modernity has four major institutions – capitalism, industrialism, the capacity for surveillance and military power – he points to three distinct yet interconnected sources which underlie the dynamism of modernity – the separation of time and space, the development of disembedding mechanisms and the continual reflexive appropriation of knowledge.</p> <p>В современности происходит рассоединение пространства и времени. Важнейшим следствием этого явление становится высвобождение социальных взаимодействий из локального контекста, которые происходят теперь в неопределенных временных и пространственных измерениях (Giddens 1990a, 12)</p> <p>The first mechanism consists of symbolic tokens, of which money is paradigmatic, and refers to media which can be exchanged regardless of who uses them. The second type of disembedding mechanism consists of expert systems: ‘By expert systems I mean systems of technical accomplishment of professional expertise that organise large areas of the material and social environments in which we live today’ (Giddens 1990a, p. 21)</p> <p>Like symbolic tokens, expert systems permit the removal of social relations from their immediate context and their transferral across space and time. Fundamental to both forms of disembedding mechanism, as well as to the reflexivity definitive of modernity, is the concept of trust. Trust refers to a form of ‘faith’, or, more precisely, it derives from faith in the fact that certain outcomes will arise, or in the reliability of a person or a system. The interface between individuals and abstract systems occurs at ‘access points’ which take the form of ‘faceless commitments’ in relation to abstract systems, and ‘facework commitments’ in relation to persons</p> <p>For Giddens, a sense of trust in processes, people and things is a crucial factor in maintaining a sense of ontological security in the modern world: the absence of trust results in existential angst or dread. Ontological security in premodern societies has to be understood in relation to contexts of trust and forms of risk and danger which were anchored in the local circumstances of place. Four localised contexts of trust existed: kinship, local community, religious cosmology and tradition itself.</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9AP9DA7U\Steven Loyal-The Sociology of Anthony Giddens-Pluto Press (2003).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"R9DGZEJ8","book","1991","Giddens, Anthony","Modernity and Self–Identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age","","978-0-7456-0932-4","","","","This major study develops a new account of modernity and its relation to the self. Building upon the ideas set out in The Consequences of Modernity, Giddens argues that ′high′ or ′late′ modernity is a post traditional order characterised by a developed institutional reflexivity. In the current period, the globalising tendencies of modern institutions are accompanied by a transformation of day–to–day social life having profound implications for personal activities. The self becomes a ′reflexive project′, sustained through a revisable narrative of self identity. The reflexive project of the self, the author seeks to show, is a form of control or mastery which parallels the overall orientation of modern institutions towards ′colonising the future′. Yet it also helps promote tendencies which place that orientation radically in question – and which provide the substance of a new political agenda for late modernity. In this book Giddens concerns himself with themes he has often been accused of unduly neglecting, including especially the psychology of self and self–identity. The volumes are a decisive step in the development of his thinking, and will be essential reading for students and professionals in the areas of social and political theory, sociology, human geography and social psychology.","1991","2019-05-15 13:10:25","2019-05-15 13:10:25","","","264","","","","","Modernity and Self–Identity","","","","","Polity Press","Cambridge","Anglais","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.fr/Modernity-Self-Identity-Self-Society-Modern/dp/0745609325","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2QQYJ8X5","journalArticle","","Gilroy, Connor; Kashyap, Ridhi","Extending the Demography of Sexuality with Digital Trace Data","","","","","","A core challenge in the demography of sexuality is accurate and detailed measurement of sexual preferences in the population. We approach this challenge using digital trace data from Facebook’s advertising platform to obtain aggregate estimates for sexuality in the United States, stratified by age, gender, geography, and relationship status. We find our data to be a good predictor of variation in other sources of sexual minority prevalence, Gallup and the American Community Survey. We then go beyond these sources to characterize our population in terms of age, gender, and bisexual or same-gender interest. We find a higher willingness to disclose sexuality among younger cohorts than older, and among heterosexual men than women. Conversely, we find large numbers of young bisexual women. Ultimately, 4.2 million or 2% of Facebook users in the United States disclose non-heterosexual interests, encompassing a large proportion of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals in the US.","","2019-04-24 21:52:01","2019-05-11 18:05:59","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Любопытно, применяют термин ""digital trace data"" без всяких пояснений:</p> <p>In this paper, we contribute to the demography of sexuality in the United States by<br />using novel digital trace data to elaborate on the sexuality of a large proportion of the<br />US population in terms of its age and gender profile, as well as geographic variations.</p> <p>We obtain this demographic data using the Facebook Ads application programming<br />interface</p> <p><strong>ХОТЯ НЕТ, ЭТО ЧЕРНОВИК, НЕ НАДА НА НЕГО ОРИЕНТИРОВАТЬСЯ</strong></p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2MGYD5L5\Gilroy и Kashyap - Extending the Demography of Sexuality with Digital.pdf","","беде","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has often been associated with the terms “big data” and “computational social science.” Using such data, social scientists have argued, will enable us to better understand social, political, and economic life. Yet this new data type comes not only with promises but with challenges as well. These include developing standards for data collection, preparation, analysis, and reporting; establishing more systematic links between established theories within the existing body of research in the social sciences; and moving away from proofs-of-concepts toward the systematic development and testing of hypotheses.

Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means?

Beauty contests are widely used in procuring welfare-to-work projects, freelance services, selling online ads, real estate transactions, and hiring, dating/marriage decisions. Unlike price-only auctions, beauty contests have no closed-form bidding strategies and suffer from nonmultiplicatively separable unobserved auction heterogeneity, which makes their estimation challenging. To address these challenges, we formulate beauty contests as incomplete information games and present a two-step estimator. A key contribution of our method is its ability to account for common-knowledge auction-specific unobservables using finite unobserved types. We show that unobserved auction types and distributions of bids are nonparametrically identified and recoverable in the first step using a nonparametric Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm, and that these can then be used in the second step to recover cost distributions. We present an application of our method in the online freelancing context. We find that seller margins in this marketplace are around 15% of the bid, and that not accounting for unobserved heterogeneity can significantly bias cost estimates in this setting.

For a generation, roughly from 1945 to 1970, business and government leaders embraced a vision of an American workforce rooted in stability. But over the last fifty years, job security has cratered as the postwar institutions that insulated us from volatility--big unions, big corporations, powerful regulators--have been swept aside by a fervent belief in ""the market."" Temp tracks the surprising transformation of an ethos which favored long-term investment in work (and workers) to one promoting short-term returns. A series of deliberate decisions preceded the digital revolution and upended the longstanding understanding of what a corporation, or a factory, or a shop, was meant to do.Temp tells the story of the unmaking of American work through the experiences of those on the inside: consultants and executives, temps and office workers, line workers and migrant laborers. It begins in the sixties, with economists, consultants, business and policy leaders who began to shift the corporation from a provider of goods and services to one whose sole purpose was to maximize profit--an ideology that brought with it the risk-taking entrepreneur and the shareholder revolution and changed the very definition of a corporation.With Temp, Hyman explains one of the nation's most immediate crises. Uber are not the cause of insecurity and inequality in our country, and neither is the rest of the gig economy. The answer goes deeper than apps, further back than downsizing, and contests the most essential assumptions we have about how our businesses should work.","2018-08-21","2019-05-04 09:14:25","2019-05-10 11:23:33","","","400","","","","","Temp","","","","","Viking","New York","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Temp-American-Business-Became-Temporary/dp/0735224072","freelance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ambiguous nature of their employment status and its implications for worker well-being have attracted substantial controversy, but to date most empirical research in this area has focused on the market efficiency of a single platform rather than on workers themselves and related human resource management issues. Research progress will require understanding how online labor platform work differs from other types of nonstandard employment arrangements, as well as critical differences across labor platform firms in how work and workers are managed. This paper proposes a conceptual classification framework to facilitate research on the attitudes, experiences, and outcomes of workers who use these platforms.

An exploration of the characteristics of technology-mediated work on Upwork, including contract structure, wages, consistency of work, risk-management strategies, and profiles of clients and freelancers follows. The findings suggest that despite the company’s emphases on efficiency, flexibility, and freedom from the physical office, freelancers face significant trade-offs in undertaking such work, notably its infrequency, barriers to high wages, and intense global competition.

Telepressure has been linked with negative stress and health outcomes, but the existing measure focuses on experiences specific to the workplace. The current study explores whether an adapted version of the workplace telepressure measure is relevant to general social interactions that rely on information and communication technologies. We validated a general telepressure measure in a sample of college students and found psychometric properties similar to the original workplace measure. Also, general telepressure was related to, but distinct from, the fear of missing out, self-control and technology use. Using a predictive validity design, we also found that telepressure at the beginning of the semester was related to student reports of burnout, perceived stress and poor sleep hygiene 1 month later (but not work–life balance or general life satisfaction). Moreover, telepressure was more strongly related to more negative outcomes (burnout, stress and poor sleep hygiene) and less positive outcomes (work–life balance and life satisfaction) among employed compared with non-employed students. Thus, the costs of staying connected to one's social network may be more detrimental to college students with additional employment obligations.

However, research from the stress and recovery literature suggests that the defining features of workplace telepressure interfere with needed work recovery time and stress-related outcomes. The present set of studies defined and validated a new scale to measure telepressure. Study 1 tested an initial pool of items and found some support for a single-factor structure after problematic items were removed. As expected, public self-consciousness, techno-overload, and response expectations were moderately associated with telepressure in Study 1. Study 2 demonstrated that workplace telepressure was distinct from other personal (job involvement, affective commitment) and work environment (general and ICT work demands) factors and also predicted burnout (physical and cognitive), absenteeism, sleep quality, and e-mail responding beyond those factors.

Marketplace like Airbnb or Uber offer such digital platforms to connect previously unmatched demand-side and supply-side participants through innovative forms of value creation, delivery and capture. While countless firms claim to offer the next ‘Airbnb for X’ or ‘Uber for Y’, we lack knowledge about the defining business model characteristics of these marketplaces. To close the gap, this paper provides a conceptually and empirically grounded taxonomy of their business models. Applying a mixed methods approach, it first develops an integrative framework of marketplace business models. Guided by the framework, the research systematically analyzes 100 randomly selected marketplaces with content analysis and binary coding. The gathered data is analyzed with cluster analysis techniques to develop a taxonomy for marketplace business models. The clustering process reveals six clearly distinguishable types of marketplace business models and thus shows that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating, delivering, and capturing value with marketplaces and platforms in general. We characterize these distinctive types on basis of the qualitative and quantitative findings. Among others, we find that two of these types are highly aligned with business model characteristics associated with the so-called sharing economy. The findings are discussed against platform, marketplace, and sharing economy literature to contribute to a higher integration of different literature streams that are concerned with similar organizational types and phenomena.","2018-06","2019-05-09 21:44:24","2019-05-10 11:04:43","2019-05-09 21:44:24","319-329","","3","36","","European Management Journal","Understanding platform business models","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QDR7AD3U\Täuscher и Laudien - 2018 - Understanding platform business models A mixed me.pdf","","online marketplace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beauty contests are widely used in procuring welfare-to-work projects, freelance services, selling online ads, real estate transactions, and hiring, dating/marriage decisions. Unlike price-only auctions, beauty contests have no closed-form bidding strategies and suffer from nonmultiplicatively separable unobserved auction heterogeneity, which makes their estimation challenging. To address these challenges, we formulate beauty contests as incomplete information games and present a two-step estimator. A key contribution of our method is its ability to account for common-knowledge auction-specific unobservables using finite unobserved types. We show that unobserved auction types and distributions of bids are nonparametrically identified and recoverable in the first step using a nonparametric Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm, and that these can then be used in the second step to recover cost distributions. We present an application of our method in the online freelancing context. We find that seller margins in this marketplace are around 15% of the bid, and that not accounting for unobserved heterogeneity can significantly bias cost estimates in this setting.

At the same time, (analogue) social theory may benefit from the affordances of digital methods. This article explores this Janus-faced argument by way of a Facebook crawl of the Swedish field of culture. First, it is argued that field theory helps understand inter-institutional interaction on social media, and that it places activities on social media in a broader social context. Findings of the Facebook crawl illustrate the persistence of the structure and autonomy of the field of culture as depicted by Bourdieu. Second, despite Bourdieu’s rejection of network analysis, it is argued that it supplements empirical field research on two counts. Bourdieu argued for a relational understanding of the social world and for the study of “objective relations” between agents in a field. Following this, the network analysis provides a focus on actual practices—crystallized acts of recognition in the form of “likes” between institutions. This contrasts the somewhat oxymoronic use of self-reports to study “objective relations” that to date characterize Bourdieusian sociology. Additionally, the network analysis of a crawl of institutions on social media has the capacity to begin to uncover the amplitude, or reach, of a social field—which to date is rare in empirical field research.

What sets this approach apart<br />from previous Bourdieusian research is the move beyond the<br />reliance on self-reports toward a focus upon crystallized acts<br />of recognition that “occur naturally” (Bail, 2014, p. 467),<br />that are “already there” (unlike “made data” created by surveys<br />and interviews) (Bruhn Jensen, 2010, p. 52).</p> <p>Activity on social media has frequently been studied from a<br />political economy perspective that uncovers various forms of<br />economic value creation on, for example, Facebook (see, for<br />example, Fuchs, 2010; Paasonen, 2016; Terranova, 2004).<br />Thus, when Rogers (2002) and Walker (2005) describe the<br />“economy of linking” or when Gerlitz and Helmond (2013)<br />unravel a “like economy,” they are concerned with the business<br />side of social media.</p> <p>In the online environment studied<br />here, the unit of analysis is “objective” in the sense that it<br />captures crystallized acts of recognition in the form of<br />“likes.” The transactions of “likes” are, so to speak, “found<br />data” rather than “made data” (Bruhn Jensen, 2010, p. 49).<br />The advantage of the approach, and the “found data” underlying<br />it, is that it does not require “arbitrary categorization of<br />organizations or events according to prestige by the<br />researcher” (De Nooy, 2003, p. 320).

One existential threat to cryptocurrencies is dramatic ﬂuctuations in traders’ willingness to buy or sell. Using a novel experimental methodology, we conducted an online experiment to study how susceptible traders in these markets are to peer inﬂuence from trading behavior. We created bots that executed over one hundred thousand trades costing less than a penny each in 217 cryptocurrencies over the course of six months. We ﬁnd that individual “buy” actions led to short-term increases in subsequent buy-side activity hundreds of times the size of our interventions. From a design perspective, we note that the design choices of the exchange we study may have promoted this and other peer inﬂuence effects, which highlights the potential social and economic impact of HCI in the design of digital institutions.","2018","2019-04-24 21:52:07","2019-04-24 21:52:07","2019-04-24 21:52:07","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1801.05831","Comment: CHI 2018","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\734QCASU\Krafft и др. - 2018 - An Experimental Study of Cryptocurrency Market Dyn.pdf","","","Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Physics - Physics and Society; H.5.m; J.4; K.4.2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We delineate circumstances when increases in censorship expand access to information for a substantial subset of the population. When governments suddenly impose censorship on previously uncensored information, citizens accustomed to acquiring this information will be incentivized to learn methods of censorship evasion. These evasion tools provide continued access to the newly blocked information – and also extend users’ ability to access information that has long been censored. We illustrate this phenomenon using millions of individual-level actions of social media users in China before and after the block of Instagram. We show that the block inspired millions of Chinese users to acquire virtual private networks (VPNs), and that these users subsequently joined censored websites like Twitter and Facebook. Despite initially being apolitical, these new users began browsing blocked political pages on Wikipedia, following Chinese political activists on Twitter, and discussing highly politicized topics such as opposition protests in Hong Kong.","","2019-04-24 21:51:56","2019-04-24 21:51:56","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F2CQPEPS\Hobbs и Roberts - How Sudden Censorship Can Increase Access to Infor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the debates on how to use these new data, the research potential of “digital trace data” has featured prominently. While various commentators expect digital trace data to create a “measurement revolution”, empirical work has fallen somewhat short of these grand expectations. In fact, empirical research based on digital trace data is largely limited by the prevalence of two central fallacies: First, the n=all fallacy; second, the mirror fallacy. As I will argue, these fallacies can be addressed by developing a measurement theory for the use of digital trace data. For this, researchers will have to test the consequences of variations in research designs, account for sample problems arising from digital trace data, and explicitly link signals identified in digital trace data to sophisticated conceptualizations of social phenomena. Below, I will outline the two fallacies in greater detail. Then, I will discuss their consequences with regard to three general areas in the work with digital trace data in the social sciences: digital ethnography, proxies, and hybrids. In these sections, I will present selected prominent studies predominantly from political communication research. I will close by a short assessment of the road ahead and how these fallacies might be constructively addressed by the systematic development of a measurement theory for the work with digital trace data in the social sciences.","2018-11-09","2019-04-24 21:51:55","2019-04-24 21:51:55","2019-04-24 21:51:55","9-35","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.4324/9781351209434-2","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GRQDER7Y\Jungherr - 2018 - Normalizing Digital Trace Data.pdf","","","","Stroud, Natalie Jomini; McGregor, Shannon C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Весь прошлый век на-<br />шими источниками данных служили опросы, интервью и наблюдения. Сейчас на-<br />чался следующий этап</p> <p>Новый лейбл «вычислительная социальная наука» (computational social<br />science) все чаще используется для обозначения исследовательского поля, в рамках<br />которого поведение человека анализируется при помощи новых способов произ-<br />водства, обработки и методов анализа данных (Lazer et al., 2009).</p> <p>боль-<br />шие данные оказались важными для социологии в двух отношениях. Во-первых,<br />они предоставили возможность изучать социальное поведение, доступ к которо-<br />му раньше был ограничен (McFarland, Lewis, Goldberg, 2015)</p> <p>Несмотря на некоторые попытки описать ключевые характеристики больших<br />данных, мы можем говорить скорее о лейбле, который схватывает самые разные<br />данные в  одном наименовании (Kitchin, McArdle, 2016). Этот термин потерял<br />концептуальную ясность, что хорошо показано на примере анализа Р. Китчином<br />и Дж. Макардлом 26 наборов данных, использованных в научных исследованиях.</p> <p>Исследователи полагают, что революция в больших<br />данных произошла не потому, что теперь можно иметь дело с данными большого<br />объема, главное, что данные создаются не для целей исследования (Connelly et al.,<br />2016: 2).</p> <p>Манифестом «новой науки» можно считать статью «Вычислительная социальная<br />наука», которая появилась в «Science» в 2009 году (Lazer et al., 2009).</p> <p>Гэри Кинг считает, что наиболь-<br />ший результат в социальной науке возможен, когда присутствуют три условия:<br />инновационные статистические методы, новая компьютерная наука и оригиналь-<br />ные теории отдельных областей знания (King, 2013).</p> <p>авторы пишут<br />о четырех прорывах в анализе данных. Первый связан с большими массивами тек-<br />стовых данных и отсылает к области вычислительной лингвистики, второй раз-<br />вивает сетевой анализ, третий опирается на достижения машинного обучения,<br />наконец, четвертый использует возможности онлайн-экспериментов (McFarland,<br />Lewis, Goldberg, 2015).</p> <p>Позиция крайнего эмпиризма представлена в статье аналитика Криса Андерсона,<br />который раньше возглавлял журнал «Wired». В 2008 году он провозгласил «конец<br />теории» и необходимость отказа от научного метода в его прежнем виде.</p> <p>Господствующий<br />ныне научный стиль американской социологии сформировался к концу 1970-х го-<br />дов, и сейчас он доминирует на страницах ведущих социологических журналов.<br />Главное его отличие — это применение опросных инструментов и статистики для<br />проверки заранее сформулированных гипотез. Считается, что в исследованиях<br />американской социологии теория предшествует этапу сбора данных, который на-<br />правлен на поиск статистической поддержки заранее сформулированных гипотез<br />(McFarland, Lewis, Goldberg, 2015; Pontille, 2003).</p> <p>Все больше можно встретить работ, посвященных противопоставлению теоре-<br />тико-ориентированной науки (theory-driven) исследованиям, которые занимают<br />эмпирицистскую позицию «идти от данных» (data-driven science). В таких иссле-<br />дованиях гипотезы могут возникнуть из характера доступных данных (Kitchin,<br />2014: 6). Эти работы призывают перестать делать вид, что гипотезы формулиру-<br />ются до того, как исследование было начато и окончено (Goldberg, 2015; McAbee,<br />Landis, Burke, 2017).</p> <p>Очень интересная ссылка, по поводу теоретизирования задним числом:</p> <p>Это довольно изящно продемонстрировал М. Теплицкий, когда сравнил, как<br />изменялись тексты социологов от варианта развернутого доклада на конференции<br />до статьи в научном журнале (Teplitskiy, 2016). Если бы социологические исследования действительно запускались теоретически<br />обоснованным вопросом, Теплицкий вряд ли бы обнаружил, что после процеду-<br />ры рецензирования главным образом меняется теоретическое обрамление статьи,<br />тогда как анализ данных остается без заметных изменений. </p> <p>Существует и более радикальное предложение — развернуть социологию от ка-<br />узальных объяснений в сторону описаний. М. Сэвидж и Р. Берроуз не просто при-<br />зывают инкорпорировать большие данные в свои работы, но предлагают занять-<br />ся исследованиями, в которых будет больше паттернов, чем объяснений (Savage,<br />2009; Burrows, Savage, 2007).</p> <p>Одна из главных причин, почему публика перестала интересоваться социо-<br />логией, это наше снисходительное отношение к описанию. Публика жаждет<br />описания, но мы слишком презираем этот жанр. Сосредотачиваясь на одной<br />только каузальности, мы отказываем в публикации статьям с чистым опи-<br />санием, даже если описание выполнено с использованием количественных<br />методов и имеет важные содержательные выводы. В то же время коммерче-<br />ские фирмы платят миллионы за такую работу, получается, что наше обще-<br />ство фактически «описывается» самым детальным образом частными мар-<br />кетинговыми компаниями. Но мы, хотя и любим считать, что ответственны<br />за публичное знание об обществе, презираем и описания и методы, которые<br />обычно используются для количественных исследований. Наши социальные<br />индикаторы представляют собой почти случайный набор переменных, при-<br />годных для каузального анализа. (Abbott, 2001: 121)</p> <p>Есть<br />мнение, что пока мы чаще имеем дело с рассуждениями о применении больших<br />данных в социальных науках, чем действительно с исследованиями, которые стро-<br />ятся на их анализе (Halavais, 2015).</p> <p>именно сейчас принципиально важно обсудить, что может измениться<br />в социологии при переориентации исследователя со сбора данных на постановку<br />вопросов к уже существующим массивам.</p> <p>Наибольшее внимание исследователей пока сосредоточено на том, чтобы опре-<br />делить отличия новой социальной науки, исследования в которой далеко не всегда<br />носят линейный характер. Гораздо реже обсуждается вопрос об эпистемологиче-<br />ском статусе нового типа данных. В статьях почти по умолчанию считается, что<br />большие данные — подлинные и объективные. Если они не создавались по запро-<br />су исследователя, то якобы обладают большей надежностью. Однако стоит пом-<br />нить, что в случае больших данных «исследователь не только лишен возможности<br />влиять на инструмент, но и нередко не может наблюдать его в действии» (Волков,<br />Скугаревский, Титаев, 2016: 51).</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PUQR2W3T\SocOboz_17_1_213-236_Guba.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RLZ5T5W7\217766689.html","","беде","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications.

In other words, it means that the truster has conﬁdence that the trustee will care about his or her beneﬁts, and that the truster is willing to rely on the trustee’s decision even when the result is not visible immediately (Kini and Choobineh, 1998).</p> <p>Trust can also be deﬁned as a belief that one party can rely on a word or promise given by another party, and it can also help to develop or maintain a relationship between the two parties (Zaltman and Moorman, 1988).</p> <p>Boeyen and Moses (2003) argue that trust can be separated into two basic types, namely direct trust and third-party trust. Direct trust is a trust relationship developed by the two parties themselves.

Therefore trust can reduce the trusters’ willingness to enjoy the services or products offered by the trusted company’s competitors (Gambetta, 2000; Zaheer et al., 1998). Moreover, trust is able to increase the end-users’ motivation to cooperate with the other party in an uncertain situation (McKnight and Chervany, 2002). End-users are usually more willing to work with the party they trust than a party with whom they have not developed any kind of a trust relationship, especially in an environment they are unfamiliar with or unable to control. </p> <p>Today, trusted relationships are not created only between people or between people and organisations but can also be found between people and computing systems, or people and shopping agents (Lee and Turban, 2001).</p> <p>McKnight et al. (2002) suggest three important inﬂuential factors related to the development of the trust relationship between online companies and end-users, namely the safety of the online trading environment, the company’s goodwill and the quality of the web site.</p> <p>To examine how trust elements can affect end-users’ behaviour, McKnight and Chervany (1996) analysed six constructs of trust: (1) trusting beliefs; (2) trusting intention; (3) trusting behaviour; (4) system trust; (5) dispositional trust; and (6) situational decision to trust.</p> <p>Unlike traditional purchasing channels, customers making purchases on the net are not able to touch, feel or test most of the products or services provided by the online shops before they make an order</p> <p>The other reason explaining why online transactions are more risky than ofﬂine transactions is that the vendor is always unobserved and, at times, even unknown. Customers not only have to run the risk that the products received from online shops are of unacceptable quality, but also that they might not even receive the ordered item at all</p> <p>Literature is consistent in claiming that trust is a very important element in successful web-based business (e.g. Ba et al., 2003; Hoffman et al., 1999; Keat and Mohan, 2004; Kim and Benbasat, 2003; Lee et al., 2006; Lee and Turban,</p> <p>trust has a great inﬂuence on end-users when they decide whether to participate in e-commerce or not (Lee et al., 2006).</p> <p>There seems to be a general agreement in literature that trust is an essential ingredient of customer relationships in the online world (Kini and Choobineh, 1998; Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004; Siau and Shen, 2003).</p> <p>Trust can help to mitigate the customers’ worries about the risks and uncertainties of conducting complicated businesses online (Lee and Turban, 2001; McKnight and Chervany, 2002) and encourage them to participate in online activities.</p> <p> В построении доверия онлайн --- The impact of web site quality is the most pertinent (see also Briggs et al., 2004).</p> <p>The major barrier for most end-users related to the give-away of personal information and/or purchasing online is often related to the lack of trust in the other party’s ability to keep the personal information safe.

To do this, we develop a parsimonious model of a frictional matching market for services, which lets us derive the elasticity of labor demand and supply, the split of surplus between buyers and sellers, and the eﬃciency with which requests and oﬀers for services are successfully matched. We estimate the model using data from TaskRabbit, a rapidly expanding platform for domestic tasks, and report three main ﬁndings. First, supply is highly elastic: in periods when demand doubles, sellers work almost twice as hard, prices hardly increase and the probability of requested tasks being matched only slightly falls. Second, we estimate average gains from each trade to be $37. Because of the matching frictions and search costs needed to ﬁnd potential matches, the ex-ante gains are more modest, but are maximized by the elastic labor supply: if the number of hours worked were held constant, there would be 15 percent fewer matches in equilibrium. Third, we ﬁnd that platform success varies greatly across cities. The cities which grow fast in the number of users are also those where the market fundamentals promote eﬃcient matching of buyers and sellers. This heterogeneity in matching eﬃciency is not attributable to scale economies, but is instead related to two measures of market thickness: geographic density (buyers and sellers living close together), and level of task standardization (buyers requesting homogeneous tasks).","","2018-04-09 10:36:04","2018-04-25 12:56:03","","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>The Internet has facilitated the growth of peer-to-peer marketplaces for the exchange of underutilized<br />goods and services.

Central to Macneil’s argument is the proposition that relational exchange is based on a social component, largely represented by trust. Specifically, the parties involved in relational exchange derive ‘non-economic satis- factions and engage in social exchange as well as . . . economic exchange’ (Macneil, 1980: 13;</p> <p>This line of reasoning is consistent with the work of sociologists such as Powell (1990) and Granovetter (1985), who develop the notion of embeddedness</p> <p>Economic exchange relations thus depart from ‘pure economic motives’ and ‘become overlaid with social content that carries strong expectations of trust and abstention from oppor- tunism’ (Granovetter, 1985: 490).</p> <p>The significant social component in economic action is generally ignored in economic explanations of exchange activity, and is frequently consigned to the error term or to ‘noise’ (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992). However, economists such as Arrow (1973: 24) have also recognized that ‘there is an element of trust in every transaction’</p> <p>Hill (1990) argues that contrary to the classic transaction cost view that opportun- ism generally characterizes exchange, it is relationships based on cooperation and trust that are more likely to survive in the marketplace.</p> <p>empirically, the assumption that opportunism characterizes exchange should be reconsidered in favor of one that suggests that trust does.</p> <p>Transaction cost theorists such as Williamson (1985) have recognized the abundance of inter- mediate governance forms and suggest that, under certain conditions, these ‘relational’ forms are maintained by economic weapons such as hostages and credible commitments to keep opportunistic behavior at bay. However, this view of relational governance is somewhat at variance from that articulated by Macneil (1980) and Dore (1987), who conceive of relational exchange as supported by non-economic factors such as trust. It is possible that over time, relational forms evolve from using economic safeguards to protect specific assets to employing trust in this way (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7MCR2ZVA\Zaheer и Venkatraman - 1995 - Relational governance as an interorganizational st.pdf","","доверие","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, trust is able to overcome the liabilities of newness since trust signals <br />that a company produces quality services and goods (Welter, 2012). Third, when trust is high <br />between various actors in a society, it serves as a resource to enhance performance, productivity, <br />and entrepreneurial success.

Today, social networking and social computing have become hot topics, and those of us doing research in this space are nally nding a wealth of opportunities to share our work and to collaborate with others. This book is a collection of chapters that cover all the major areas of research in this space. I hope it will serve as a guide to students and researchers who want a strong introduction to work in the eld, and as encouragement and direction for those who are considering bringing their own techniques to bear on some of these problems. It has been an honor and privilege to work with these authors for whom I have so much respect and admiration. Thanks to all of them for their outstanding work, which speaks for itself, and for patiently enduringall my emails. Thanks, as always, to Jim Hendler for his constant support.

Multi-Sited Ethnography in Sociological Research","","","","","","Doing participating observation in the ""field"" is an indispensable characteristic of ethnography. Yet, the problems of constructing a field for ethnographic research attract surprisingly little attention in textbooks and research reports. Sociological ethnography does hardly ever aim at giving holistic representations of clearly bounded (small) groups. It rather focuses on certain theoretically defined aspects of a given culture. Therefore, defining and delineating a field becomes a crucial step in an empirical study. In our article we propose a concept of the field as social world(s) constituted by a set of actors focused on a common concern. With the example of our ongoing research project on exclusion and integration in welfare and economy we argue for a multisited approach, which traces its inherently fragmented and multiply situated research object across social worlds. We discuss the problems arising from such a strategy and discuss the function of the field in theory driven sociological ethnography. We contend that multi-sited ethnography is particularly suited for building empirically grounded sociological theories.","2005","2018-04-16 06:46:44","2018-04-16 06:46:44","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\T34I7D23\Nadai и Maeder - 2005 - Fuzzy Fields.

However research efforts toward characterizing and forecasting this risk is limited due to the paucity of information regarding suicide ideation, exacerbated by the stigma of mental illness. This paper fills gaps in the literature by developing a statistical methodology to infer which individuals could undergo transitions from mental health discourse to suicidal ideation. We utilize semi-anonymous support communities on Reddit as unobtrusive data sources to infer the likelihood of these shifts. We develop language and interactional measures for this purpose, as well as a propensity score matching based statistical approach. Our approach allows us to derive distinct markers of shifts to suicidal ideation. These markers can be modeled in a prediction framework to identify individuals likely to engage in suicidal ideation in the future.

Big data sizes are a constantly moving target, currently ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set. This chapter addresses some of the theoretical and practical issues raised by the possibility of using massive amounts of social and cultural data in the humanities and social sciences. These observations are based on the author’s own experience working since 2007 with large cultural data sets at the Software Studies Initiative at the University of California, San Diego. The issues discussed include the differences between ‘deep data’ about a few people and ‘surface data’ about many people; getting access to transactional data; and the new “data analysis divide” between data experts and researchers without training in computer science.","2012-01-01","2018-01-16 07:25:59","2018-01-22 13:35:08","","","460","","","","","Trending","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DOI: 10.5749/minnesota/9780816677948.003.0047","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SH8DAAPU\64-article-2011.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293108461_Trending_The_Promises_and_the_Challenges_of_Big_Social_Data","беде","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facing the big data challenge, scholars have to answer the question about the nature of the data they used before. The basic characteristics of big data (3V — volume, velocity, variety) allow drawing up the mass behavior forecasting models more efficiently than the public opinion sociology does. Taken into account constant criticism over the forecasting based on public surveys, this feature makes Big Data more attractive for the research community. The article considers two strategies that the public opinion sociology can use in response to Big Data: criticism and search for vulnerabilities (D. Boyd, K. Crawford, J. Fan, H. Liu, D. Lazer, M.

Opportunities and limitations of two different sociologic approaches related to the social network analysis “social network analysis” and “relational sociology” are considered by the author. With the emergence of the Internet several new topics have been put on the sociological agenda: social network analysis, big data; rethinking the methodology of data collection and production; changing nature of the object of sociology. The basic conclusions are as follows. The online space, from its origins until now, has been an amorphous social phenomenon without existing structures (social forms), without institutional hierarchy but with strong and frequent new semiotic streams, with a topology not yet known to us. Credible hypotheses including such categories as “human”, “culture”, “structures” should be proposed to understand and forecast the evolution of the complicated social systems. Sociologists will get rid of the naturalistic absolutization of such categories as “space”, “time”, “social structures”. New practices and social technologies will be introduced to better understand and predict things, events and meanings. The semiotics will take strong positions in sociological studies; it will deal with the observed socio-cultural phenomena (system of proximity, myths, fashion, behavior patterns) providing researchers with an “access code” to the everyday life.","2015","2018-01-16 16:15:22","2018-01-22 13:32:33","2018-01-16 16:15:22","","","2 (125)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cyberleninka.ru","","","<p>Философии пока... ненадо?</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SYDEWB2L\А.м - 2015 - Интернет и будущее социологии.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RERJV4IF\internet-i-buduschee-sotsiologii.html","","соотечественники","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Исследования с использованием цифровых данных начали развиваться, однако основываются на моделях социальной реальности, появившихся в то время, когда большинство данных социологи получали опросными методами. В статье выдвигается предположение, что для более продуктивного использования цифровых данных необходимо пересмотреть базовые модели, которые лежат в основании социологических исследований. Целью статьи является поиск ответа на вопрос, как изменения в характере доступных социологам данных повлияют на пересмотр моделей социальной реальности и социального актора.

Ко всему этому добавляется то преимущество, что подобные данные уже “транскрибированы”, представлены в виде записей. В настоящее время люди оставляют больше записанных следов и свидетельств своей жизни, чем во все предыдущие эпохи, что предоставляет новые возможности для социологических исследований и, прежде всего, позволяет отойти от сбора количественных и качественных данных преимущественно опросными методами. Трактовка сети Интернет как пространства следов, которые могут быть расшифрованы с помощью специальных методов, предполагает, что цифровые данные могут рассказать не только о самом Интернете и его особых субкультурах, но и о социальной реальности, частью которой они являются. “Основной вопрос больше не в том, сколько общества и культуры находится в сети Интернет, а в том, как, используя Интернет, можно изучать культурные изменения и социальные условия.

The first strategy refers to the researcher’s focus on traditional sociological analysis restricted by small sample size; the second one implies maximal use of the growing open source data. The challenges a researcher has to face when dealing with big data are as follows: (1) data extraction; (2) data processing and improvements; (3) data visualization. This is why a researcher should master coding and programming. Sociologists with humanitarian education should choose R statistical environment and Python programming language becasue they have simple syntax and allow solving complicated data processing, analysis and visualization tasks.

Севидж и Бэррэу отмечают, что социологи занимают маргинальную позицию в исследовательской деятельности. Речь идет не о традиционном выяснении позиции социологии в сравнении с естествен- ными науками, а о месте социологов в структуре институций, занимающихся сбором, анализом, хранением и применением разного рода социальной информации. Долгое время социологам удавалось успешно развивать и использовать методы, ориентиро- ванные на сбор сведений об общественных настроениях и ценностных ориентациях населения. В настоящее время складывается ситуация, когда для многих социальных агентов больше нет необходимости обращаться за информацией к результатам массо- вых опросов [Savage, 2009: 765].</p> <p>Ну, пример про телекоммуникационные компании и вывод: Используя лексику акторно-сетевой теории, можно сказать, что академическая социология перестает быть “obligatory point of passage” (обязательным пропускным пунктом) для агентов, обладающих властью [Savage, Burrows, 2007: 886]. </p> <p><strong>Оп-па, еще одна, блядь, концептуализация:</strong></p> <p>В последние годы социологи заговорили об очередном “повороте”, теперь уже цифровом (digital turn). В 2009 г. появляется термин “цифровая социология” [Wynn, 2009] и в 2013 г. вышла первая книга, полностью посвященная этой теме [Orton-Johnson, Prior, 2013]</p> <p>Развитие цифровых устройств и новых информационных технологий представляет собой вызов всему методологическому аппарату социологии, так как дает возможность анализи- ровать гораздо большие объемы информации, чем прежде, что, в свою очередь, ведет к изменению фактуальной основы знания. Факты, на которых строятся социологиче- ские объяснения, становятся более многочисленными, меняют свою форму, требуют применения новых методов и ведут к переосмыслению места и роли теоретического знания в исследовательском процессе. В этом контексте теории и методы, социологи- ческие данные могут подвергнуться существенным трансформациям</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Про контроль над генерацией данных:</span></p> <p>Социологи разработали множество методов сбора дан- ных, причем одной из отличительных особенностей всегда была именно работа их с первичными данными, в отличие, например, от экономистов, работающих преимущест- венно со статистикой.</p> <p>С развитием информационных технологий увеличиваются мас- штабы сбора социальных данных без участия социологов. Распространение данных, которые теперь рутинно собираются и анализируются во все возрастающих масшта- бах посредством автоматизированных систем сбора и обработки данных ставит под вопрос значимость ряда традиционных социологических методов работы с данными. Кроме сбора данных государственными структурами все больше данных собирается в рамках частного сектора (через анкеты покупателей/клиентов, карточки лояльности и пр.), в сети Интернет и т.п. К так называемым “транзакционным данным” относятся как данные, которые вводятся самими пользователями, так и данные, автоматически генерируемые на основании введенных сведений. Данные, введенные пользовате- лями сети Интернет, интересны для социологов, поскольку здесь можно получить в свободном доступе не только простейшую информацию о фактах поведения, но и раз- вернутые описания личного опыта, и визуальные образы, и развернутые нарративы по определенным темам. Отличием этих данных от тех, которые традиционно собирают социологи, является их естественность и спонтанность, не требующая создания ис- кусственной экспериментальной ситуации, как в анкетном опросе, а также отсутствие стандартизации, которая в большей или меньшей степени всегда сопровождает сбор социологической информации.</p> <p>Изменения в характере данных фиксируются термином “большие данные” (big data), который подчеркивает несколько аспектов кардинальных изменений в количе- стве и качестве данных, в формах их организации и методах работы с ними. С точки зрения количественного аспекта появляется возможность анализировать большие объемы данных по определенной проблеме и использовать все имеющиеся данные по исследуемой проблеме, а не только лишь их часть (выборку), что позволяет выявлять значимые взаимосвязи даже в отсутствие каких бы то ни было гипотез и предположе- ний. Но количественная сторона больших данных не является их абсолютной харак- теристикой. Например, данные обсуждения отдельно взятой темы в Twitter, которые формально попадают под категорию больших данных, существенно меньше количест- венно, чем, например, данные переписи населения [Boyd, Crawford, 2012: 663].</p> <p>Трансформация методов. Если традиционные социологические методы на- правлены на извлечение данных из тщательно отобранных источников, то в эпоху больших данных подобные методы могут стать излишними. Несмотря на то, что боль- шие данные часто не упорядочены, они упорядочиваются в процессе выбора целей исследования. В начале поиска исследователям не обязательны жестко исследова- тельские вопросы, на которые они хотят найти ответы, так как сами вопросы часто тоже вырастают из имеющихся данных. Такой подход вроде бы напоминает мягкий дизайн качественных исследований, но в отличие от последнего в случае больших данных речь идет о переборе возможных комбинаций с использованием разного рода математических методов. Таким образом, методы математической обработки данных выходят на первый план.</p> <p>Большие данные могут заставить социологов смириться с неопределенностью и беспорядочностью в пользу вероятностности и скорости. Отсутствие навязывания априорных классификаций позволяет использовать основное преимущество больших данных – отслеживание изменений в режиме реального времени, причем потеря в точ- ности в данном случае позволяет выигрывать в скорости. Когда с большими данными начинают работать традиционными методами, выделяя априорные критерии класси- фикации и осуществляя поиск информации в соответствии с ними, это преимущество теряется. В эпоху больших данных требуются методы, которые позволят отслеживать потоки информации в динамике, производя динамическую визуализацию социальных сетей и структур коммуникации [Tinati, Halford, 2012]. В этом контексте традицион- ные методы сбора данных, используемые социологами, оказываются громоздкими и неповоротливыми, что особо актуально в областях, где от социологов ждут быстрых результатов и практических рекомендаций, например, в маркетинговых и электораль- ных исследованиях, социологии катастроф и стихийных бедствий и т.п. - <em>Короче, это она за необходимость анализа сетей.</em></p> <p>При наличии избыточного количества дан- ных опора на модели может потерять свое ключевое значение. Традиционный путь исследования, который состоит в разработке теоретических моделей, формулиров- ке гипотез, сборе данных для проверки гипотез и затем в объяснении полученных взаимосвязей, может существенно сократиться.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Вот это мне нравится, как сказано:</span></p> <p>Рост доступности и количества социальных данных ведет к изменению роли и функций теоретических моделей в исследовательском процессе. Многие социологические теории довольно громоздки и имеют очень опосредованную связь с социальной реальностью.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Изменение характера социологических объяснений.</span> Современные цифровые тех- нологии дают возможность отслеживать потоки действий и коммуникаций. При этом не всегда имеются данные о социально-демографических характеристиках пользовате- лей и их мотивах, знание которых традиционно рассматривалось как условие предска- зания поведения и построения моделей объяснения социальной деятельности. Можно предположить, что изобилие данных о самом поведении и о результатах действий в условиях отсутствия или недостаточного количества информации о социально-де- мографических и прочих индивидуальных характеристиках пользователей должно трансформировать модели объяснения. Нет необходимости привязывать действия к социально-демографическим переменным, если известны модели возможных дей- ствий, которых могут придерживаться акторы, обладающие разными характеристи- ками. В данной ситуации фокус внимания исследователей перемещается с изучения социально-демографических характеристик, индивидуальных смыслов и интерпрета- ций, связанных с теми или иными действиями, на изучение самих действий и их после- довательностей, сетей и группировок. Таким образом, исследование фокусируется не на факторах, влияющих на индивидуальное поведение, а на потоках действий, что дает возможность получать над-индивидуальные объяснения социальных процессов.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Следует призыву к отказу от причинно-следственных объяснений</span></p> <p>Таким образом, именно переменные, которые могут быть зафиксированы с помощью современных информационных технологий, могут составить основу социо- логических объяснений, а поиск причин отходит на второй план. </p> <p>Еще одна вероятная перспектива трансформации социологических объяснений связана с возможностью отслеживания показателей в динамике, а изменений в ре- альном времени</p> <p>Переосмысление представлений о выборке и репрезентативности. В эпоху больших данных исследователю могут быть доступны данные обо всей генеральной совокупности. Один из возможных ответов предлагает так называемая “постдемография” – способ изучения персональных данных в социальных сетях, в особенности изучение того, как формируются “профили” пользователей. Основанием формирования “социальной группы” служит профиль, который не сводится к набору социально-демографических характеристик. При изучении профилей пользователей объектами интереса выступают не традиционные демографические переменные – раса, этничность, возраст, доход, образование и пр., а, например, вкусы и предпочте- ния пользователей в различных сферах [Rogers, 2009b].</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8A6E9FJG\Dudina.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2UT6BUPP\index.html","","парсинг; беде; соотечественники","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, endogeneity can arise incidentally from a large pool of regressors in a high-dimensional regression. This causes the inconsistency of the penalized least-squares method and possible false scientific discoveries. A necessary condition for model selection consistency of a general class of penalized regression methods is given, which allows us to prove formally the inconsistency claim. To cope with the incidental endogeneity, we construct a novel penalized focused generalized method of moments (FGMM) criterion function. The FGMM effectively achieves the dimension reduction and applies the instrumental variable methods. We show that it possesses the oracle property even in the presence of endogenous predictors, and that the solution is also near global minimum under the over-identification assumption. Finally, we also show how the semi-parametric efficiency of estimation can be achieved via a two-step approach.","2014-06","2018-01-15 08:52:49","2018-01-22 13:28:51","2018-01-15 08:52:49","872-917","","3","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1204.5536","<p>Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/13-AOS1202 the Annals of Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EXSEBF3G\Fan и Liao - 2014 - Endogeneity in high dimensions.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PGH9JI7I\1204.html","","эпистемология","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Opportunities and limitations of two different sociologic approaches related to the social network analysis “social network analysis” and “relational sociology” are considered by the author. With the emergence of the Internet several new topics have been put on the sociological agenda: social network analysis, big data; rethinking the methodology of data collection and production; changing nature of the object of sociology. The basic conclusions are as follows. The online space, from its origins until now, has been an amorphous social phenomenon without existing structures (social forms), without institutional hierarchy but with strong and frequent new semiotic streams, with a topology not yet known to us. Credible hypotheses including such categories as “human”, “culture”, “structures” should be proposed to understand and forecast the evolution of the complicated social systems. Sociologists will get rid of the naturalistic absolutization of such categories as “space”, “time”, “social structures”. New practices and social technologies will be introduced to better understand and predict things, events and meanings. The semiotics will take strong positions in sociological studies; it will deal with the observed socio-cultural phenomena (system of proximity, myths, fashion, behavior patterns) providing researchers with an “access code” to the everyday life.","2015","2018-01-16 07:40:16","2018-01-16 07:40:16","2018-01-16 07:40:16","","","2 (125)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cyberleninka.ru","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\T5C287M6\А.м - 2015 - Интернет и будущее социологии.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GLIXRTQB\internet-i-buduschee-sotsiologii.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data represents the data being generated by the digitization of social life, which we break down into three domains: digital life, digital traces, and digitalized life. We argue that there is enormous potential in using big data to study a variety of phenomena that remain difficult to observe. However, there are some recurring vulnerabilities that should be addressed. We also outline the role institutions must play in clarifying the ethical rules of the road. Finally, we conclude by pointing to a few trends that are not yet common in research using big data but will play an increasing role in it.

Различия в подходах должны рассматриваться как преимущества.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Что включают в себя большие данные</span></p> <p>Термин «большие данные» — это своего рода описание больших по объему и разнообразных по составу характеристик, практик, технических приемов, этических проблем и последствий, которые связаны с данными.</p> <p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Характеристики больших данных</span></strong></p> <p>Объем, скорость, многообразие, Изменяемость (непоследовательность данных во времени), Достоверность (возможность безошибочно доверять данным), и Комплексность (необходимость стыковать многочисленные источники данных).</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Большие данные получаются, а не создаются</span></p> <p>Часто в литературе для специалистов не указывают важный для исследователей общественного мнения факт — большие данные чаще всего являются вторичными данными, первоначально предназначенными для других целей. Это означает, что большие данные как правило изначально не имеют прямого отношения к исследовательским задачам, и лишь повторно используются исследователями для социологических наблюдений. Здесь можно говорить о том, что Шон Тейлор назвал разницей между «полученными» и «созданными» данными<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> [Taylor, 2013]. </span></p> <p>Когда исследователь общественного 20 Отчет AAPOR о больших данных: 12 февраля 2015 мнения создает инструментарий, появляются уровни контроля и планирования, которых принципиально нет в методиках больших данных. Источники больших данных могут иметь всего несколько переменных, в то время как результаты опросов располагают большим набором переменных, интересующих исследователя. В 2011 году бывший директор Бюро переписи населения США Роберт Гроувз опубликовал в журнале Public Opinion Quarterly и своём директорском блоге статью, где описывает схожие различия между «органическими» и «сконструированными» данными<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> [Groves, 2011a, Groves, 2011b].</span></p> <p>В контексте изучения общественного мнения, исследователи могут измерять мнения, получив быстрые ответы на темы, которые могут никогда не возникнуть в источниках больших данных. С другой стороны, «полученные» данные социальных сетей не вызваны реакцией на исследование, то есть возникают естественным образом, так что замеры, не связанные с действиями исследователя, могут более точно репрезентировать настоящее мнение или поведение. «Найденные» данные могут показывать поведение, например, журнал шагов в сетевых шагомерах или ранее упомянутые записи о путешествиях; и эти данные могут оказаться куда более точными, чем те, которые «выcпрашиваются» в опросах, когда само озвучивание проблемы может привести к смещениям [Tourangeau et al., 2000].</p> <p>поскольку данные не были созданы специально для исследования, то во многих случаях отсутствовали и меры по получению информированного согласия, что приводит к этическим вопросам.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">По поводу возможностей генерализации:</span></p> <p>Кроме того, есть и статистические вопросы относительно репрезентативного характера таких данных. </p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Изменение парадигмы</strong></span></p> <p>Изменение свойств нового типа данных трансформативно. Основные характеристики — скорость, объём, многообразие — и способ, которым эти данные собираются, означают, что новая аналитическая парадигма открыта для статистиков и социологов [Hey et al., 2009]. В классической статистической парадигме исследователи формулировали гипотезу, определяли состав выборки, разрабатывали инструментарий и методику выборочного исследования, а потом анализировали результаты [Groves, 2011a]. Новая парадигма означает, что сегодня возможно собирать данные в цифровом виде, семантически их согласовывать, сводить и коррелировать. Такие сопоставления данных могут вызывать доверие [Halevy et al., 2009, Cukier, Mayer-Schoenberger, 2013] или подозрение (Couper 2013), но в любом случае они позволяют совершать совершенно новые расчёты, большинство из которых были невозможны при использовании только данных опроса.</p> <p>По сравнению с опросным миром процесс производства в больших данных сильно отличается.</p> <ol> <li>Дешевле</li> <li>могут вызвать существенные затраты при проверке и обработке - вместо разработки дизайна и выборки исследования нужно перейти к структурированию, соединению и контролированию новых видов данных.</li> </ol> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Большие данные - польза для исследователей</span></p> <p>Польза для исследователей общественного мнения потенциально огромна. К новому способу сбора данных относятся как к «четвертой парадигме» в науке [Hey et al., 2009], и необходимость соединения социальной и компьютерной наук в виде анализа больших данных признается большинством профессиональных ассоциаций [Schenker et al., 2013]. Одним из очевидных преимуществ является то, что это дает исследователю набор новых аналитических инструментов. В дополнение к тщательному сбору данных, основанному на гипотезах, новые данные обладают, как это отметил Роберт Гроувз [Groves, 2011а], четырьмя особенными качествами, которые необходимо добавить к исследовательскому мировоззрению: (1) стремятся измерить поведение, а не внутренние установки, такие как отношения и убеждения; (2) предлагают записи о явлениях в псевдореальном времени; они очень темпорально раздроблены; (3) основываются на нескольких переменных, у многих есть только какой-то идентификатор и одна переменная (например, текст твита, координата GPS); и (4) редко предлагают четко определённое покрытие большого населения</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Процесс сбора и проблема качества</span></p> <p>Большие данные обычно агрегируются из различных источников, по разным временным основаниям и собираются в некоторые наборы данных. Для этого требуется связывать между собой записи, преобразовывать их, создавать новые переменные, одновременно документируя все преобразования данных. </p> <p>Основная проблема слишком большой скорости изменения больших данных — это неконтролируемость инструментов и методов, по которым собираются данные, что ставит под сомнение валидность и надежность, их пригодность для научного анализа.</p> <p><em>А вот тут я бы сделал поправочку. У нас же фишка в том, что судим мы не о реальных людях, а о пользователях. То есть, все, что они о себе указали, валидно. </em></p> <p>Нельзя игнорировать и риск несоответствия данных, например, автоматизированные системы могут быть специально созданы для генерирования контента. Следовательно, большие данные зачастую имеют весьма слабую связь с качественными, проверенными сведениями. Ответственность аналитиков — чётко осознавать и описывать ограничения данных и предпринимать необходимые меры для ограничения возможных эффектов и ошибок</p> <p>платформы периодически изменяют алгоритмы расчёта, что приводит к ошибкам в любых долгосрочных исследованиях.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Проблемы возникают и из-за большого размера данных:</span></p> <p>Многомерность данных также может приводить к ложным корреляциям (2), когда многие несвязанные признаки оказываются сильно связанными просто случайно, и в результате появляются ложные открытия и ошибочные заключения. Например, используя смоделированные генеральные совокупности и относительно небольшие выборки, Фань и его коллеги [Fan et al., 2014] показали, что при 800 независимых признаках, вероятность аналитика найти точные корреляции с коэффициентом выше 0,4 составляет 50%</p> <p><em>Значит, 1. нельзя полагаться исключительно на эмпирику и 2. Оценивать силу эффекта.</em></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Несколько красивых слов на тему изменений, современности и др.</span></p> <p>Исследование общественного мнения вступает в новую эру, в которой традиционные массовые опросы могут играть менее значимую роль. Распространение новых технологий, таких как мобильные устройства и социальные медиа-платформы меняют социальный ландшафт, который, в свою очередь, является полем деятельности исследователей общественного мнения. По мере того, как скоро распространяются данные технологии, через различные платформы (социальные сети) открывается и доступ к мыслям, чувствам и действиям, воспроизводимым пользователями спонтанно, взаимосвязано и зачастую в публичной форме. Способы, с помощью которых люди получают и обмениваются информацией относительно мнений, взглядов, особенностей поведения, за последнее десятилетие подверглись большей трансформации, чем в любой из предшествующих периодов истории, и эта тенденция, вероятно, будет сохраняться. Широкое распространение социальных медиа и мнений пользователей, высказываемых на этих площадках, подталкивает исследователей к поиску новых инструментов сбора данных, увеличивает дополнительное число источников качественной и количественной информации и в некоторых случаях создает альтернативу традиционным методам сбора данных.

This model has been used to find the most probable structure in a network to describe the interdependence of these factors in five European welfare state regimes. The advantage of this study is that it offers a specific picture to describe the complex interrelationship between socioeconomic determinants and health, producing a network that is controlled by socio-demographic factors such as gender and age.

The analysis begins by contextualizing the growth of freelancing in a transformation of capitalism to a mode of flexible accumulation. It is framed against neoliberal narratives about the creative economy, including promises of financial success and freedom from rigid Fordism. An exploration of the characteristics of technology-mediated work on Upwork, including contract structure, wages, consistency of work, risk-management strategies, and profiles of clients and freelancers follows. The findings suggest that despite the company’s emphases on efficiency, flexibility, and freedom from the physical office, freelancers face significant trade-offs in undertaking such work, notably its infrequency, barriers to high wages, and intense global competition. The discussion addresses structural drivers of precarity in the marketplace and of its ongoing success.","2017-05-27","2018-07-23 20:56:47","2018-07-23 20:56:47","2018-07-23 20:56:47","220-233","","3","34","","","“Boundaryless” in the creative economy","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\H5D4URFR\15295036.2017.html","","","online marketplace; creative economy; flexible accumulation; hope labor; Online freelancing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are seen not only in the relationship between society and the state, but also in the “para-constitutional” institutions of the dual state. This article argues that whereas Medvedev created an arena for liberalization within these para-constitutional structures, Putin has firmly rejected these policies, among other things by revising the 1995 law on NGOs amended in 2006. Using the perspective of the dual state, the article argues that with the introduction of the Law on Foreign Agents (2012), the original law draft On Public Control (2014), a key element in Medvedev's modernization program, was delayed and substantially altered. Together, these amendments create precarious conditions for NGOs, pressuring their independence by threats of dissolution and reducing the quality of civil control over state organs.","2016-03-03","2018-07-10 15:20:06","2018-07-10 15:20:06","2018-07-10 15:20:06","103-131","","2","32","","","Resurgent authoritarianism","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UURXLLA6\1060586X.2015.html","","","Russia; civil society; competitive authoritarianism; dual state; Law on Foreign Agents; Law on Public Control; qualitative research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is far less plausible to imagine a cyber attack campaign unaccompanied by other elements of information warfare—in large part because almost all situations where cyber attacks are useful are those which offer no good reason not to use other elements of information warfare. Thus the various elements of information warfare should increasingly be considered elements of a larger whole rather than separate specialties that individually support kinetic military operations.]","2017","2018-07-07 16:35:08","2018-07-07 16:35:08","2018-07-07 16:35:08","49-65","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amidst a plethora of approaches to solve such problems, machine-learning techniques have found success in a variety of scenarios. In this paper we discuss the design of a machine learning-based semi-supervised job title classification system for the online job recruitment domain currently in production at CareerBuilder.com and propose enhancements to it. The system leverages a varied collection of classification as well clustering algorithms. These algorithms are encompassed in an architecture that facilitates leveraging existing off-the-shelf machine learning tools and techniques while keeping into consideration the challenges of constructing a scalable classification system for a large taxonomy of categories. As a continuously evolving system that is still under development we first discuss the existing semi-supervised classification system which is composed of both clustering and classification components in a proximity-based classifier setup and results of which are already used across numerous products at CareerBuilder. We then elucidate our long-term goals for job title classification and propose enhancements to the existing system in the form of a two-stage coarse and fine level classifier augmentation to construct a cascade of hierarchical vertical classifiers. Preliminary results are presented using experimental evaluation on real world industrial data.","","2018-06-20 21:02:04","2018-06-20 21:02:04","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KW35AC3E\Javed и др. - Towards a Job Title Classification System.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Malls link consumers and merchants; newspapers connect subscribers and advertisers. What’s changed in this century is that information technology has profoundly reduced the need to own physical infrastructure and assets. IT makes building and scaling up platforms vastly simpler and cheaper, allows nearly frictionless participation that strengthens network effects, and enhances the ability to capture, analyze, and exchange huge amounts of data that increase the platform’s value to all. </span></p> <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Guardian; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">Пайплайн противопоставляется платформе.

In a pipeline world, those include tangible assets such as mines and real estate and intangible assets like intellectual property. With platforms, the assets that are hard to copy are the community and the resources its members own and contribute, be they rooms or cars or ideas and information. In other words, the network of producers and consumers is the chief asset.</span></p> <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Guardian; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">Pipelines seek to maximize the lifetime value of individual customers of products and services, who, in effect, sit at the end of a linear process. By contrast, platforms seek to maximize the total value of an expanding ecosystem in a circular, iterative, feedback-driven process. Sometimes that requires subsidizing one type of consumer in order to attract another type.</span></p> <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Guardian; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">The competitive forces described by Michael Porter (the threat of new entrants and substitute products or services, the bargaining power of customers and suppliers, and the intensity of competitive rivalry) still apply. But on platforms these forces behave differently, and new factors come into play. To manage them, executives must pay close attention to the interactions on the platform, participants’ access, and new performance metrics.</span></p> <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Guardian; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;""><strong>The Power of Network Effects</strong><br />The engine of the industrial economy was, and remains, supply-side economies of scale. Massive fixed costs and low marginal costs mean that firms achieving higher sales volume than their competitors have a lower average cost of doing business. That allows them to reduce prices, which increases volume further, which permits more price cuts—a virtuous feedback loop that produces monopolies. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Guardian; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">In the internet economy, firms that achieve higher “volume” than competitors (that is, attract more platform participants) offer a higher average value per transaction.

We address this issue by developing a conceptual framework that focuses on selected sources of first-mover advantage delineated in the extant literature and advance propositions concerning sources that will have a greater or lower effect in the IME relative to the PME. A central message for first-movers in the IME that emerges from our conceptual analysis is to focus on achieving superior positions in resources that would enable them to get close to the customers fast, create switching costs, and retain them though ongoing investments in multi-faceted innovations. A second message that emerges for first-movers in the IME is they must take note of and make strategic adjustments for the potentially diminished significance of some traditional sources of first-mover advantage. These sources include spatial preemption, preemptive investment in capacity, and consumers’ choice behavior under conditions of uncertainty about product quality. We discuss the implications for further conceptual and empirical work in this area of increasing significance.","2008-09-01","2018-06-12 21:39:56","2018-06-12 21:39:56","2018-06-12 21:39:56","293-308","","3","36","","J. of the Acad.

The village market and the village matchmaker were 2SPs; eBay and Match.com are more recent examples. Other examples include payment card systems, magazines, shopping malls, and personal computer operating systems. Building on the seminal work of Rochet and Tirole (2003), a rapidly growing literature has illuminated the economic principles that apply to 2SPs generally. One key result is that 2SPs may find it profit-maximizing to charge prices for one customer group that are below marginal cost or even negative, and such skewed pricing pattern is prevalent, although not universal, in industries that appear to be based on 2SPs. Over the years, courts have also recognized that certain industries, notably payment card systems and newspapers, now understood to be based on 2SPs, are governed by unusual economic relationships. This chapter provides an introduction to the economics of 2SPs and its application to several competition policy issues.","2005-09","2018-06-12 21:23:01","2018-06-12 21:23:01","2018-06-12 21:23:01","","","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w11603","","D:\Dropbox\literature\National Bureau of Economic Research2005\Evans_Schmalensee_2005_The Industrial Organization of Markets with Two-Sided Platforms.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GCNUAEP5\w11603.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11603","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a key consequence of this diffusion process<br />Internet applications have revolutionized transactions, both for businesses and for<br />final consumers. The Internet’s effects on (lower) transaction costs and increased<br />competition have been widely recognized</p> <p>concerns have recently emerged about competition in these Internet service<br />markets themselves.</p> <p>The European Commission as well as the US Federal Trade<br />Commission have been investigating various business practices of Google, eBay and<br />other well-known Internet firms, and consumers also appear to be increasingly<br />skeptical about the market power of firms such as Facebook</p> <p>As the firms’ conduct<br />is increasingly encountered with suspicion by competition authorities and consumer<br />protection organizations alike, the obvious question has emerged whether current<br />competition law instruments are sufficient to address the emerging competition<br />concerns in digital platform markets.</p> <p>On the<br />one hand, it is rather obvious that many very successful Internet-based companies are<br />nearly monopolists. Google, Youtube, Facebook, and Skype are typical examples for<br />Internet firms who currently dominate their relevant markets and who leave only<br />limited space for a relatively small competitive fringe. Furthermore, most of these<br />providers do not generate content themselves, but “only” provide access to different<br />content on the Internet. On the other hand, the crucial question from a competition<br />policy perspective is not so much whether these firms have such a dominant position<br />today, but rather why they have such a large market share and whether this is a<br />temporary or non-temporary phenomenon.</p> <p>Do these Internet monopolies enjoy a<br />dominant position because they are protected from competition though barriers to<br />entry or do they just enjoy the profits of superior technology and innovation? Are we<br />observing some sort of Schumpeterian competition where one temporary monopoly is<br />followed by another, with innovation as the driving competitive force, or are we<br />dealing with monopoly firms that mainly try to foreclose their markets through<br />anticompetitive behavior? These are the key questions of this paper.</p> <p>In contrast to conventional markets, the degree of competition in Internet markets is<br />often (but not always) determined by direct and indirect network effects and<br />switching costs (Evans and Schmalensee 2007).</p> <p>A market is typically called twosided<br />if indirect network effects are of major importance (Peitz 2006; Vogelsang<br />2010).</p> <p>direct<br />network effects mean that the utility that a user receives from a particular service<br />directly increases with an increasing number of other users (Rohlfs 1974; Katz and<br />Shapiro 1985). The classical example are telecommunications networks, as, for<br />example, a service such as Skype</p> <p>Similarly, if a large customer base is already using a certain social network such<br />as Facebook, LinkedIn or XING this attracts even more users to join</p> <p>Еще есть непрямые сетевые эффекты, когда выгода от пользования сетью растет по мере увеличения кол-ва потенциальных контрагентов. Например, продавцам выгодно, когда на платформе много покупателей. Пример Ебэя: er (Rochet<br />and Tirole 2003, 2006; Evans and Schmalensee 2007)</p> <p>From a competition policy point of view it is important to note that network effects<br />often make large platform sizes indispensable in order to achieve an efficient utilization<br />of the platform. Hence, high market concentration levels cannot simply be interpreted in<br />the same manner as in conventional markets without network effects (see, e.g., Wright<br />2004).</p> <p>Следовательно, недостаточно убедить присоединиться только игроков одного типа.</p> <p>High concentration levels that result from indirect network effects are not an<br />entirely new phenomenon that has only emerged in Internet markets. The concentration<br />of trade on one single marketplace is very well known from various exchanges<br />and centralized market places.</p> <p>Следовательно, имея дело с двусторонним рынком, возникает вопрос об уровне концентрации и его детерминантах.</p> <p>Не всегда наблюдается высокая степень централизации: Counter-examples are online real<br />estate brokers, travel agents, and many online dating sites, where several competing<br />platforms co-exist</p> <p>As Caillaud and Jullien (2003) and Jullien (2005)<br />have shown, a monopoly platform can be efficient because network effects are maximized<br />when all agents manage to coordinate over a single platform. Hence, strong network<br />effects can easily lead to highly concentrated market structures, but strong network effects<br />also tend to make these highly concentrated market structures efficient.</p> <p>In contrast,<br />capacity constraints (and the associated risk of platform overload), heterogeneous preferences<br />(and the resulting potential for platform differentiation) and users’ so-called multihoming<br />possibilities (i.e., the possibility to participate in several platforms at the same<br />time) tend to drive competition into digital markets. Therefore, it is not only unclear how<br />market concentration and consumer welfare are related in these platform markets, but also<br />whether the market is quasi naturally converging towards a monopoly structure. As Evans<br />and Schmalensee (2008, pp. 679 ff. have outlined, there are five driving forces which<br />determine the concentration process and level in two-sided-markets</p> <p>. In general, it can be observed that many twosided<br />markets are characterized by a cost structure with a relatively high proportion of fixed<br />costs and relatively low variable costs (see, e.g., Jullien 2006)</p> <p>Три критерия качества поисковика:</p> <p>1.

While the strength of these<br />effects differs heavily between markets and platforms, the effects are typically more<br />important than in standard “physical” markets.

"48D2E2FM","encyclopediaArticle","2018","","Platform economy","Wikipedia","","","","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Platform_economy&oldid=841960347","The platform economy is economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such platforms are typically online matchmakers or technology frameworks. By far the most common type are ""transaction platforms"", also known as ""digital matchmakers"". Examples of transaction platforms include Amazon, Airbnb, Uber and Baidu. A second type is the ""innovation platform"", which provides a common technology framework upon which others can build, such as the many independent developers who work on Microsoft's platform. Forerunners to contemporary digital economic platforms can be found throughout history, especially in the second half of the 20th century. Yet it was only in the year 2000 that the ""platform"" metaphor started to be widely used to describe digital matchmakers and innovation platforms. Especially after the financial crises of 2008, companies operating with the new ""platform business model"" have swiftly came to control an increasing share of the world's overall economic activity, sometimes by disrupting traditional business. Examples of this include the decline of BlackBerry and Nokia due to competition from platform companies, the closing down of Blockbuster due to competition from Netflix, or the many other bricks and mortar retailers that have closed in part due to competition from Amazon. Platform expert David S. Evans wrote that in 2015, three of the top five companies in the world used the platform business model, as did seven of the ten top start up companies. Traditional businesses need not always be harmed by platforms however, they can create their own platforms or make use of existing third party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture ""81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years."" In the year 2000 there were only a handful of large firms that could be described as platform companies. As of 2016, there were over 170 platform companies valued at US$1 billion or more. The creation and usage of digital platforms is also increasing in the government and NGO sectors. The rise of platforms has been met by a mixed response from commentators. Many have been enthusiastic, arguing that platforms can improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, provide flexibility and accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Arguments against platforms include that they may worsen technological unemployment, that they contribute to the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection, that they can worsen declining tax revenues, and that excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. Since the early 2010s, the platform economy has been the subject of many reviews by academic groups and NGOs, by national governments and by trans national organisations like the EU. Early reviews were generally against the imposition of heavy regulation for the platform economy. Since 2016, and especially in 2017, some jurisdictions began to take a more interventionist approach.","2018-05-19","2018-06-12 20:30:26","2018-06-12 20:30:26","2018-06-12 20:30:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 841960347","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9H44HZC2\index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I begin by briefly describing the basic ideas surrounding the role of reputation in facilitating trust and trade, and offer an overview of how feedback and reputation systems work in online marketplaces. I then describe the literature that explores the effects of reputation and feedback systems on online marketplaces and highlight some of the problems of bias in feedback and reputation systems as they appear today.

An online survey methodology was employed to collect data including Big Five personality traits (NEO-FFI-R), impulsivity (BIS-11), sensation seeking (ImpSS), and demographic information. The data set contained information on the consumption of 18 central nervous system psychoactive drugs. Correlation analysis demonstrated the existence of groups of drugs with strongly correlated consumption patterns. Three correlation pleiades were identiﬁed, named by the central drug in the pleiade: ecstasy, heroin, and benzodiazepines pleiades. An exhaustive search was performed to select the most eﬀective subset of input features and data mining methods to classify users and non-users for each drug and pleiad. A number of classiﬁcation methods were employed (decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian mixture, probability density function estimation, logistic regression and na¨ıve Bayes) and the most eﬀective classiﬁer was selected for each drug. The quality of classiﬁcation was surprisingly high with sensitivity and speciﬁcity (evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation) being greater than 70% for almost all classiﬁcation tasks. The best results with sensitivity and speciﬁcity being greater than 75% were achieved for cannabis, crack, ecstasy, legal highs, LSD, and volatile substance abuse (VSA).","2015-06-20","2018-05-18 14:39:17","2018-05-18 14:39:17","2018-05-18 14:39:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1506.06297","Comment: Significantly extended report with 67 pages, 27 tables, 21 figures","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZMJ4H7KE\Fehrman и др. - 2015 - The Five Factor Model of personality and evaluatio.pdf","","","Statistics - Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Никлас Луман в книге ""Доверие и власть"" (1979) отметил, что доверие становится необходимым условием общественного разви- тия в силу нарастания неуверенности людей в будущем, связанного с увеличением сложности и непрозрачности современных обществ [2]. Причины обращения социо- логов к данной проблеме в первую очередь связаны с устойчивым парадигмальным сдвигом внутри самой социологической науки - преобладанием культурной проблема- тики среди актуальных социологических изысканий, с акцентом на культурной обу- словленности действия.</p> <p>Доверие/недоверие в его социологиче- ском анализе выступает как важный показатель отношения людей друг к другу и к то- му обществу, в котором они живут, а также в качестве одной из характеристик их со- циальных ожиданий и поведенческих стратегий.</p> <p>Проблема доверия появляется в случае неопределенности и неконтролируемости будущего. Иными словами, нам не- обходимо доверие, если у нас нет уверенности в полном контроле над будущими собы- тиями, зависящими от человеческих действий.</p> <p>Штомпка приходит к наиболее общему определению: ""Доверие есть ставка в отношении буду- щих непредвиденных действий других""</p> <p>В концепции Штомпки понятие доверия самым непосредственным образом связа- но с другим важным понятием - риска. Доверять - значит действовать так, как если бы риска не было, ""поставить риск за скобки"".</p> <p>Доверие ста- новится ""способом примириться со сложностью будущего, порожденного технологи- ей"" (Н. Луман).</p> <p>Вообще, разрабатывает обширную классификацию, которая не особенно интересна, честно.</p> <p>Рассматривая онтологический статус доверия, Штомпка предлагает три взаимодо- полняющих ответа, выделяя, таким образом, три измерения доверия. 1) Доверие как характеристика отношений (односторонних или взаимных). Преимущественно этот уровень доверия разрабатывается в теориях рационального выбора. +доверие как психологическая и культурная характеристики.</p> <p>С учетом выделенных уровней доверия - реляционного, психологического и куль- турного - Штомпка предлагает рассматривать и основания доверия. В первом случае оказание доверия базируется на оценке информации с точки зрения того, в какой ме- ре участники отношения заслуживают доверия (познавательная сторона доверия).</p> <p>Общее заключение по доверию:</p> <p>Штомпка приходит к выводу, что доверие в целом выполняет положительную функцию для доверяющего, для того, кому доверяют, для их отношений, для группы, организаций и более широких сообществ. Доверие освобождает и мобилизует челове- ческое действие; поощряет творческий, инновационный, предпринимательский акти- визм по отношению к другим людям; снижает неопределенность и риск, связанные с человеческими действиями, и в итоге, ""возможности действия возрастают пропорцио- нально возрастанию доверия"" (Н. Луман). Диаметрально противоположные выводы сделаны в отношении недоверия.</p> <p>Основания оценки доверия - через увелчиение функциональности общества в целом.</p> <p>для появления ""культуры доверия"" должны быть как структурные возможности, поощряющие доверие, так и агентные ресурсы - готовность и желание агентов воспользоваться этими возможностями. Штомпка называет пять макросоцие- тальных обстоятельств, которые благоприятствуют появлению ""культуры доверия"", тогда как противоположность им производит ""культуру недоверия"": (1) нормативная со- гласованность / нормативный хаос (аномия); (2) стабильность социального порядка / ра- дикальные изменения; (3) прозрачность социальной организации / секретность; (4) ощу- щение понятности окружающего мира / ощущение неизведанности; (5) подотчетность других людей и институтов / произвол и безответственность.</p> <p> </p>","","","доверие","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Кто чаще сталкивается с проблемами?

Каким образом разрешаются возникающие конфликты?</p> <p>мы можем констатировать, что более 70% фрилансеров так или иначе испытывали сложности при работе в удаленном режиме. Наиболее распространенные из упомянутых проблем: изменение исходных задач работы (45%) и задержка оплаты (40%), а также «исчезновение» заказчика (26%), полная или частичная невыплата гонорара (22%), отмена уже выполняемого заказа без компенсации (18%), сокращение сроков на выполнение заказа (10%).</p> <p>--- Все это согласно опросам, проведенным среди фрилансеров и заказчиков в 2008 и 2010 годах.</p> <p>Так, хорошая статистика по видам оппортунизма и их распространенности.

Социальные каналы поиска работы связаны с опорой на информацию, циркуляция которой ограничивается определенным кругом людей, так или иначе связанных друг с другом (через личное знакомство или рекомендации). То есть в этом случае заказы приходят от неанонимных заказчиков. Подобные каналы включают отношения с постоянными заказчиками; рекомендации клиентов, контрагентов, партнеров; рекомендации друзей и знакомых.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\YGUNH3XE\53714115.html; D:\Dropbox\literature\2012\Олегович_Вячеславович_2012_Механизмы защиты от оппортунизма на электронных рынках услуг.pdf","","доверие; биржи","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ESZB9DY5","book","2018","Luhmann, Niklas","Trust and Power","","978-1-5095-1946-0","","","","In this important book, Niklas Luhmann uses his powers as an analyst of the social system to examine two of the most important concepts which hold that system together and allow it to evolve: trust and power. He criticises those theoretical accounts whose roots lie in what he refers to as ideologies – accounts which use implicit beliefs in particular conceptions of human nature to explain and predict social action in a one-dimensional way. Theories of rational choice and moralistic explanations are taken to task, as are the theories of both Marx and Habermas. Luhmann's unique scientific sociology underpins every page and enables him to highlight the potential shortcomings of these narrative approaches. Underlying this approach is the idea that ideologically-based social theory, whether critical or conservative, is unable to do justice to the complexities existing within the parameters of social systems, individuals, and the interactions between them. He aims to show instead how only a painstaking systems analysis can capture these intricacies. Although written over 40 years ago, Luhmann's complex vision of the operations of trust and power provides a wealth of insights of considerable value to scholars and students grappling with contemporary social and economic problems. The editors' introduction to this new edition and the significant revisions they have made to the translation will help to reveal the richness and clarity of this vision and its relevance to the ways that trust and power operate in today's society.","2018-03-15","2018-05-13 11:01:29","2018-05-13 11:01:29","","","262","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: CKBRDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=CKBRDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When interacting with one another, users face privacy risks through personal information being revealed to the wrong people, ﬁnancial risks by doing business with unreliable parties, and certainly inconvenience when spam or other unwanted content is sent their way. Similarly, information provided by users can be overwhelming because there is so much of it and because it is often contradictory. In some cases, it is simply frustrating for users to try to ﬁnd useful movie reviews among thousands or to ﬁnd a news report that matches the user’s perspective. In other cases, such as when considering health information, ﬁnding insight from trusted sources is especially important. While users could formely judge the trustworthiness of content based on how “professional” a website looked [1, 2], most of this new content is on third party sites, effectively eliminating visual clues as helpful factors.</p> <p>Короче, так.

Drawing on a multi-year study with digital workers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-east Asia, this article highlights four key concerns for workers: bargaining power, economic inclusion, intermediated value chains, and upgrading. The article shows that although there are important and tangible benefits for a range of workers, there are also a range of risks and costs that unduly affect the livelihoods of digital workers. Building on those concerns, it then concludes with a reflection on four broad strategies – certification schemes, organising digital workers, regulatory strategies and democratic control of online labour platforms – that could be employed to improve conditions and livelihoods for digital workers.","2017-05","2019-11-17 16:32:51","2020-01-22 15:29:28","2019-11-17 16:32:51","135-162","","2","23","","Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research","Digital labour and development","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>Work is turned into acommodity in which workers are transformed into a ‘computation service’ (Irani, 2015).</p> <p>Rather thanbeing relatively unregulated markets, digital labour platforms play hugely important roles in regulating,managing, assigning, and monitoring work (see Agrawal et al., 2013; Kenney and Zysman, 2016; Parkeret al., 2016).</p> <p>A key feature of digital work platforms is that they attempt to minimise the outside regulation ofthe relationship between employer and employee (Lehdonvirta, 2016).</p> <p>Workers are, for instance,generally classified as independent contractors (even though their work sometimes more closely resembles that of an ‘employee’) (a finding discussed in more detail in Wood et al., 2016).</p> <p>The fuller context, therefore, is one whereby demand is relatively geographically concentrated, but supply is relatively geographically diffuse and workers from low- and high-income countries end up competing in the same contexts: a situation that is likely to have an impacton the relative degrees of bargaining power exerted by individual digital workers</p> <p>the graphic broadly reveals that median wages are, perhaps unsurprisingly, low in low-incomecountries and are significantly higher in medium- and high-income countries. It also reinforces thefact that the market for work is highly international: with the United States being the only countryin which a majority of work is commissioned by domestic clients. This may suggest that US digitalworkers receive higher wages because of their embeddedness in local institutional structures. Digital workers are also statistically more likely to find work in their domestic market (World Bank,2016). Some studies have also shown how employers can be biased towards workers of the samenationality or ethnicity (Ghani et al., 2014).</p> <p>the interviews offered limited evidence of digital workers seeking tostrengthen their position through collective action or acts of solidarity. Interviewees oftendescribed the global pool of supply of digital workers in terms of ‘competition’ rather than‘colleagues,’ being fearful that other workers will take clients away from them.</p> <p>Con-comitantly, the dispersed geography of digital work reveals examples of employment being dis-embedded from local norms and local moral economies that would traditionally regulate anemployment relationship, and towards what might be seen as a more internationally operatingentrepreneurial moral economy based more singularly upon competition.</p> <p>In geographically circumscribed labour markets, certain segments of the population may beexcluded from the market or one of its segments entirely, due to discrimination or occupationalsegregation. For example, workers may be discriminated against on the basis of religion, ethnicity,or disability (Reskin, 2000), or segregated into certain segments of the market on the basis of theirgender or ethnicity (Maume, 1999).</p> <p>Martin, a 31-year-old content<br />writer from Lagos believed that workers from the US or UK were far more likely to get job offers and<br />thus spoke about <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">ways to mask his Nigerian profile location in digital work platforms.</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">In our</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">research, we identified evidence of disintermediation, but also more surprising network patterns,</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">such as reintermediation.</span> These findings are presented in Lehdonvirta et al. (2015b); what follows<br />is a summary of selected findings.</p> <p>Interviewees suggested that, in many cases, the relatively direct<br />connection between the client and the worker is only temporary. Some successful digital workers<br />become intermediaries themselves, taking on more work than a single person can handle, and hiring<br />other workers on the platform to carry out the work for them</p> <p>There are tangible benefits for those that make it<br />through the barriers of reputation and ranking systems.

This study uses 107 interviews and a survey of 658 freelancers who obtain work via a variety of online platforms to highlight that Internet-­based communities play a vital role in their work experiences.

Furthermore, the ""crowd"" has been viewed as a group of independent workers dispersed all over the world. Recent studies based on in-person interviews have opened up the black box and shown that the crowd is not a collection of independent workers, but instead that workers communicate and collaborate with each other. Put another way, prior work has shown the existence of edges between workers. We build on and extend this discovery by mapping the entire communication network of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a leading crowdsourcing platform. We execute a task in which over 10,000 workers from across the globe self-report their communication links to other workers, thereby mapping the communication network among workers. Our results suggest that while a large percentage of workers indeed appear to be independent, there is a rich network topology over the rest of the population. That is, there is a substantial communication network within the crowd. We further examine how online forum usage relates to network topology, how workers communicate with each other via this network, how workers' experience levels relate to their network positions, and how U.S. workers differ from international workers in their network characteristics. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for requesters, workers, and platform providers like Amazon.","2016","2019-11-18 14:12:33","2019-11-18 14:12:33","2019-11-18 14:12:33","1293–1303","","","","","","","WWW '16","","","","International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","Republic and Canton of Geneva, Switzerland","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Montréal, Québec, Canada","<p>notion of crowds as independent workers was recently<br />dispelled by Gray et al.

"WPMUJVMK","book","2019","Larsson, Anthony; Teigland, Robin","The Digital Transformation of Labor (Open Access): Automation, the Gig Economy and Welfare","","978-1-00-073108-8","","","","Through a series of studies, the overarching aim of this book is to investigate if and how the digitalization/digital transformation process causes (or may cause) the autonomy of various labor functions, and its impact in creating (or stymieing) various job opportunities on the labor market. This book also seeks to illuminate what actors/groups are mostly benefited by the digitalization/digital transformation and which actors/groups that are put at risk by it.  This book takes its point of departure from a 2016 OECD report that contends that the impact digitalization has on the future of labor is ambiguous, as on the one hand it is suggested that technological change is labor-saving, but on the other hand, it is suggested that digital technologies have not created new jobs on a scale that it replaces old jobs. Another 2018 OECD report indicated that digitalization and automation as such does not pose a real risk of destroying any significant number of jobs for the foreseeable future, although tasks would by and large change significantly. This would affects welfare, as most of its revenue stems from taxation, and particularly so from the taxation on labor (directly or indirectly). For this reason, this book will set out to explore how the future technological and societal advancements impact labor conditions.  The book seeks to provide an innovative, enriching and controversial take on how various aspects of the labor market can be (and are) affected the ongoing digitalization trend in a way that is not covered by extant literature. As such, this book intends to cater to a wider readership, from a general audience and students, to specialized professionals and academics wanting to gain a deeper understanding of the possible future developments of the labor market in light of an accelerating digitalization/digital transformation of society at large.","2019-11-11","2019-11-21 15:12:20","2019-11-21 15:12:20","","","286","","","","","The Digital Transformation of Labor (Open Access)","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: o3u9DwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=o3u9DwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Economic Conditions; Business & Economics / Labor; Business & Economics / Office Automation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Largely critiquing traditional concepts of community as well as current dystopian perspectives on the fluid and vapid state of social organisation, it will show how individualism has been incorporated into societal norms, producing highly autonomous personalised networks that, when combined with large amounts of social interaction and imaginative cultural appropriation, create the common social and cultural practices emblematic of community structure. It also illustrates how many activities, traditionally viewed as indicative of social decay, are socially productive, in that they go towards generating the common bonds and world-views that unite individuals across urban landscapes.

They allow for long-distance transactions and offer workers access to a potentially ‘global’ pool of labor demand. As such, they bear the potential to act as a substitute for shrinking local income opportunities. Using detailed U.S. data from a large online labor platform for microtasks, we study how local unemployment affects participation and work intensity online. We find that, at the extensive margin, an increase in commuting zone level unemployment is associated with more individuals joining the platform and becoming active in fulfilling tasks. At the intensive margin, our results show that with higher unemployment rates, online labor supply becomes more elastic. These results are driven by a decrease of the reservation wage during standard working hours. Finally, the effects are transient and do not translate to a permanent increase in platform participation by incumbent users. Our findings highlight that many workers consider online labor markets as a substitute to offline work for generating income, especially in periods of low local labor demand. However, the evidence also suggests that, despite their potential to attract workers, online markets for microtasks are currently not viable as a long run alternative for most workers.","2018","2019-12-25 09:42:15","2019-12-27 13:44:45","2019-12-25 09:42:15","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\S8QU5JJY\Borchert et al. - 2018 - Unemployment and Online Labor.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BCCLPDG5\papers.html","","гиг-экономика; самозанятость","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3178692","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using cluster analysis on representative data from across 12 European countries, we determine five distinct types of labour-activists, ranging from those opposed to any forms of collective action to those enthusiastic to organise and correct perceived wrongs.

When control is understood sociologically, it becomes apparent that it is a core feature of all labour relations and thus exists across employment statuses and takes various complex forms. Therefore, focusing labour law upon a fuzzy notion of control, might actually reduce existing levels of protection by causing the reclassification of workers who labour under subtle, insidious and intangible forms of control. Labour laws exist to recognise the vulnerable position of employees due to their livelihood being dependent on the person hiring them. This dependency exists regardless of the form control which an employer operates. Therefore, I argue that returning the law’s focus to dependency offers a sounder basis for determining employment classification and labour rights.","2019-03-13","2019-12-26 13:35:20","2019-12-27 13:43:00","2019-12-26 13:35:20","","","","","","","The Taylor Review","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VMHK46C4\papers.html","","регулирование труда; гиг-экономика","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3353393","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to provide evidence-based scientific support to the European policy-making process.</em></p> <p>This critical and scoping review essay analyses digital labour markets where labour-intensive services are traded by matching requesters (employers and/or consumers) and providers (workers).</p> <p>This essay tries to disentangle the rhetoric with available empirical evidence in order to enable a more rational debate at least in the discussion of policies, if not in the public arena. To do so, an in depth analysis of 39 platforms was undertaken together with a formal review of 70 scientific sources.</p> <p>While the evidence is limited and inconclusive with respect to various dimensions, the findings of this essay show, among other things, that: a) individuals engage in these activities primarily for money, for a large segment of them this work is theirprimary source of income, and most are under-employed and self-employed and fewer are unemployed and inactive; b<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">) matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies are widespread and even the OLMs are far from being globalised online meritocracies;</span></p> <p>A case in point is the discourse about gigsworkers performing tasks on digital labour markets for ‘pin money’. Here, an old idea first articulated in the 1950s and 1960s about the then-emerging temporary work agencies in the US has clearly resurfaced (Berg, 2016). More generally, the ‘sharing economy’ is today a rhetorical field that needs unpacking.</p> <p>Currently, commercial ‘sharing’ platforms operate in an institutional vacuum and stand to some extent ‘above the law’. This makes it easy for ‘detractors’ to argue that they are simply thriving on ‘regulatory arbitrage’, rather than producing innovation.</p> <p>However, it also unequivocally documents that the currently available evidence on costs and benefits is absolutely partial and not yet conclusive. There are a few exceptions where <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">data on labour platforms has been made available to researchers: i.e from Upwork, formerly Elance-oDesk, and Freelancers.</span></p> <p>1) OLMs formicro-tasking (i.e. small pieces of routine cognitive work requiring low to middle levels of skills as traded for instance in Amazon Mechanical Turk); (2) OLMs for tasking and at times delivery of entire and self-contained projects (i.e. tasks requiring middle to high skill levels such as in Upwork or Freelancers); (3) MLMs for physical services (i.e. performing low skilled manual work and errands such as in TaskRabbit); (4) MLMs for interactive services (i.e. interactive services requiring high skills such as in TakeLessons).</p> <p>These markets can be broadly consideredas part of, and related to, wider trends such asglobalisation of labour markets through the diffusion of outsourcing and offshoring, computerisation and job polarisation, the de-standardisation of work with the emergence of Non Standard Work (NSW)</p> <p>OLMs are also seen as constituting a further driverof the ‘Flat World’ and as the adventof an online global meritocracy.</p> <p>n countries such as the UK and the US,those working regularly for digital labour markets (every week) are conservatively estimated to make up between 1% and 2% of the labour force.Globally, the 39 platformsreviewed have a total of 52.6 million registered contractors (a possible under-estimation since there are more platforms out  <br />6there). Most of the platforms reviewed are from the US, whereas there are only a few European platformswith 100,000 registered contractors and international coverage.</p> <p>Temporary work can lead to precarisation, blockagesto social mobility, and wage penalties.</p> <p>Workers in digital labour markets tend to be younger and better educated than their population of reference.However, between 6% and 12% of individuals 55 and older also participate (depending on the OLMs and MLMs considered and on the country).<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Overall,women are either more represented than men or equally represented,</span> although gender stereotypes penalise them even in anonymous contexts such as OLMs.</p> <p>In the UK, for instance, according to a survey based on a nationally-representative sample,as many as 60% (2.9 million if projected on the population of reference) of those who have worked in digital labour markets at least once (11%or 4.9 million) work for several of them and are registered with between 2 and 5.</p> <p>there is fairly robust and uniformevidence to show that earnings in these markets range from very low to modest,with only a small minority of workers making above middle-level incomes.</p> <p>the claim that digital labour markets bring us back to Taylor (automated control), Smith (division of labour intopiecework), and to pre-industrial levels of work precarisation (lack of social protection).</p> <p>OLMs favour international labour flows (especially ‘North-South’) but are not as flat and as meritocratic as expected. Various barriers that can be aptly summarised by the expression <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">‘the liability of foreignness’</span>,limit the globalised trade of digital labour and the expected wage convergence.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">Non-Westerners receive only a limited wage premium (compared to their domestic markets), However,domestic contractors earn more in absolute terms and for some tasks they are preferred,regardless of qualifications. This means that OLMs are less beneficial than expected for developing countries, and also that they exert less pressure on driving down wages in more developed countries.</span></p> <p>On employmentand related labour income effects,the available evidence is limited and inconclusive. In the reviewed studies,focussing on online labour market,examples of concentration of work assignments (i.e. ‘superstar’ effectsleading to job concentration and more income inequality) were found</p> <p>in one case,less than 10% of workers account for more than 80% of work completed.</p> <p>digital labour markets are still rivenwith matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies.</p> <p>it has been proposed that an intermediate status between a contractor and an employee (dependent self-employed) be created and that digital labour markets should be made to pay at least a part of the traditional bundle of social protection provisions.</p> <p>Policy makers should acknowledge that employment in the 21stcentury is no longer a binary phenomenon (1= employed, 0= unemployed)</p> <p>between1995and2010routinejobs(i.e.accountants)fell12points(53%to41%),while highskillsabstractjobs(i.e.designers)increasedtenpointsfrom28%to38% andnon-routine manual jobs(i.e.drivers)increasedthreepointsfrom18%to21%(OECD, 2015a, p. 29)</p> <p>Another prominent narrative is that of the ‘Flat World’ whereby increasing outsourcing and off-shoring, also enabled by technology, are creating a globalised labour market (Freeman, 2008; Friedman, 2005).</p> <p>It has been observed how in the past three decades or so each new wave of digital innovation gave rise to contrasting narratives about the future of work (Baldry, 2011; Holtgrewe, 2014; Howcroft &amp; Taylor, 2014)</p> <p>routine jobs based on standard contracts (i.e. accountants) have been substituted by routine jobs in NSW forms</p> <p>The emergence of NSW is statistically associated with inequality and poverty (OECD, 2015, pp. 152-170) and is, thus, related to the ‘new inequality’ debate (Atkinson, 2015; Bernhardt, 2014; Kuttner, 2013, 2016; Standing, 2011; Summers &amp; Balls, 2015), which is a key dimension in the broader discussion of the future of work.</p> <p>P. 10 - Short bur relevant review of the terms for platform labour.</p> <p>OLMS's have been presented<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> (Horton, 2010, p. 521) and discussed empirically (Beerepoot &amp; Lambregts, 2015)</span> as drivers accelerating the flattening of labour markets through virtual migration</p> <p>Friedman’s thesis was heavily criticised empiricallyvi, whereas the evidence reviewed here suggests that flattening and wage convergence is still limited in OLMs due to a combination of matching frictions and employers’ cognitive heuristics and biases</p> <p>in both types of digital labour markets work is performed under even less standard forms than ‘traditional’ NSW, which makes them an object of debate from the perspective of inequality, precarisation, and erosion of labour rights (Berg, 2016; Cherry, 2011, 2016; Kuttner, 2013)</p> <p>In OLMs work is carried out in a regulatory vacuum as the global nature of the platforms neutralises national labour laws and there is no international level agreement (Beerepoot &amp; Lambregts, 2015, p. 246);actually, as candidly stated both by Horton (2010, p. 517) and by Agrawal et al. (2013a, p. 19), platforms perform government-like functions.</p> <p>As put by economist Timothy Taylor in his blog (Taylor, 2015), the use of the ‘sharing economy’ expression to refer to various commercial platforms is a ‘triumph of public relations artistry’ (he would rather use ‘the matching economy’).</p> <p>There is no unequivocal evidence that these market favour a democratising ‘long tail’ of employment opportunities (Agrawal et al., 2013a)</p> <p><em>A great overview of positive(advent of a global online meritocracy) and negative accounts in media.</em></p> <p>Firms’ motivation in using digital labour markets and the extension of such practices remains a key empirical question</p> <p>The distinction by skills necessary for the work on the platform is of a regulatory relevance: low-skilled work may indicate that the service provider is an employee, rather than self-employed, whereas high-skilled work is more likely to be performed by an independent contractor.</p> <p><em>The authors propose a 4-quandrant scheme for digital labour markets to differentiate the platforms along the manual and interactive|online and low-to-mid-skilled|mid-to-high-skilled dimensions. </em></p> <p>What could be called the Uberisation of high-skilled or high-paying work has not so far attracted much attention, but is a new trend that is worth studying more in depth in the future.</p> <p>A brief stylised picture on NSW based on various contributionsxxi and on the data <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">available online from the Eurostat Labour Force Survey</span></p> <p><em>And then there is a whole lot of statistics. Skip it.</em></p> <p><em>On the future of online labour markets:<br /></em>With regard to the digitalisation of labour market matching, as anticipated in the introduction, information management scholars announced the future pervasiveness of the ‘e-Lance economy’ as early as 1998 (Malone &amp; Laubacher, 1998). Autor (2001, 2008), however, expressed scepticism about this possibility as he considered that the structure of these digital labour markets would be riven with information asymmetry and would not be capable of conveying the ‘high bandwidth’ kind of information needed for a job match.</p> <p><em>A few factors that can hinder the growth of the labour platforms:<br />1. Regulatory interventions<br />2. Robotisation<br />3. Failing to compete with the firms providing full employment at the high-skilled jobs. It may prove difficult to compensate insecurity with higher earnings.<br />4. Some platforms might decide to turn their suppliers into employees.<br /></em></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Glossary</p> <ol> <li>Churlish</li> <li>corroborate</li> <li>Surveys COMISSIONED by</li> <li>riven</li> <li>encroach</li> <li>In the same vein</li> </ol>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AEU3237Z\LFNA27913ENN.en.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2QBU58BI\The Future of Work in the ‘Sharing Economy’.pdf","","социология труда; гиг-экономика; география","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, they are becoming a powerful tool for researchers seeking to understand the functioning of labor markets.

It is a network that is characterised<br />by highly uneven geographies and in many ways has simply reinforced global patterns of visibility,<br />representation and voice that we are used to in the<br />offline world.</p> <p>The internet is characterised by<br />complex spatialities which are challenging to understand<br />and study, but that does not give us an excuse to<br />fall back on unhelpful metaphors which ignore the<br />internet’s very real, very material, and very grounded<br />geographies.</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NW7VWZD6\geoj.html","","социология труда; гиг-экономика; география","internet; cyberspace; space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question is, how permanent are they likely to<br />be? And will they form the basis of new collective identities? Or will workers<br />choose to group themselves in relation to some other variable, such as the<br />employer they work for, or the site where they are based? The answer to this<br />question will be a crucial determinant of the extent to which new class identities<br />will develop independently of geography, and of the potential for<br />organizing at a transnational level.</p> <p>the tendency of self-employment to die out has obstinately<br />refused to take place.</p> <p>Across the EU, for instance, the self-employed<br />constituted a hardly varying 15% of the work-force over the two decades from<br />1975 to 1996.29 This catch-all statistical category of course includes a range of<br />different class positions. At one extreme are the self-employed with a few<br />employees who can perhaps be regarded as petty bourgeois in the classic sense;<br />then there are genuine freelances, who work for a range of different employers;<br />and at the other extreme are casual workers whose self-employed status is a<br />reflection of labour market weakness—people who lack the negotiating<br />muscle to insist on a proper employment contract even though they are effectively<br />working for a single employer.</p> <p>Despite the lack of change in their overall<br />numbers, the evidence from the UK suggests that the composition of this group<br />is changing, in the direction of the casual end of the spectrum.</p> <p>it difficult to regard self-employment as a stable marker of class identity;<br />for some it might merely be a staging post between different jobs.</p> <p>Another factor which makes it difficult to regard the self-employed as a separate<br />category is the increasing tendency to manage employees ‘as if’ they are<br />self-employed or, to use Rajan’s phrase, to insist on ‘mindset flexibility’.</p> <p>Since most of these workers own their own<br />computers, it might be tempting to regard them as twenty-first-century equivalent<br />of home-based hand-loom weavers, but can stand-alone personal<br />computers really be regarded as the means of production?</p> <p>Some workers may also employ cleaners, child-care workers or other<br />servants,37 thus occupying a place in the division of labour in reproduction<br />work which is the equivalent of that of a small employer in production</p> <p>Information and communications technologies play a pivotal role in blurring<br />the boundaries between work and consumption, constituting as they do a<br />shifting interface between server and served.</p> <p>Entry to<br />the new world of information work is crucially dependent on the ability to<br />understand, speak and write English, or, in some parts of the world, French,<br />Spanish, German, Japanese or Arabic</p> <p>It is therefore not unusual to find the<br />sorts of work which are carried out by school-leavers, or graduates from junior<br />college, in the USA being carried out by graduates or post-graduates in a developing country</p> <p>There is also some evidence that<br />when selecting locations employers consciously avoid areas where workers are<br />likely to organize.</p> <p>One factor which will undoubtedly influence the propensity of workers to<br />organize and take militant action will be the extent to which this is likely to be<br />in their own economic best interests.</p> <p>It is apparent that a new cybertariat is in the making.

We focus on the role of verified work experience information in affecting online hiring decisions. Prior research shows that additional information about job applicants may disproportionately help or hinder disadvantaged populations. Using data from a major online contract labor platform, we find that contractors from less developed countries (LDCs) are disadvantaged relative to those from developed countries (DCs) in terms of their likelihood of being hired. However, we also find that although verified experience information increases the likelihood of being hired for all applicants, this effect is disproportionately large for LDC contractors. The LDC experience premium applies to other outcomes as well (wage bids, obtaining an interview, being shortlisted). Moreover, it is stronger for experienced employers, suggesting that learning is required to interpret this information. Finally, other platform tools (e.g., monitoring) partially substitute for the LDC experience premium; this provides additional support for the interpretation that the effect is due to information about experience rather than skills acquired from experience. We discuss implications for the geography of production and public policy.","2013-01","2020-01-08 07:15:17","2020-01-22 14:30:38","2020-01-08 07:15:17","","","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w18720","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QXCC7DJQ\w18720.pdf","","гиг-экономика; география","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18720","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a comparative analysis of the relative wages and the rewarding of skills and expertise of contractors from selected countries and investigate whether, via labour arbitrage, wage convergence takes place between Western and developing countries.

The activists who have put together Ours to Hack and to Own argue for a new kind of online economy: platform cooperativism, which combines the rich heritage of cooperatives with the promise of 21st-century technologies, free from monopoly, exploitation, and surveillance.The on-demand economy is reversing the rights and protections workers fought for centuries to win. Ordinary Internet users, meanwhile, retain little control over their personal data. While promising to be the great equalizers, online platforms have often exacerbated social inequalities. Can the Internet be owned and governed differently? What if Uber drivers set up their own platform, or if a city’s residents controlled their own version of Airbnb?

This phenomenon requires a robust analysis of how OLMs are evolving. In this study, we conduct a geo-economic analysis on IT service providers’ survival utilizing a unique longitudinal panel data set from an OLM, which comprises 40,874 IT service providers from diﬀerent countries over a period of more than four years (2006 to 2010). Based on results from Survival models and a series of robustness checks, we were able to decipher how geoeconomic factors (speciﬁcally the country development level) and reputation interact to determine service providers’ survival.

This setting also allows me to document how employers’ experience in past hires affects their behavior in current hires. I find that freelancers from developing countries are less likely to be hired when they have no individual reputation, and as individual reputation becomes better this country effect disappears.

Across a wide range of sectors, these firms are transforming themselves into platforms: businesses that provide the hardware and software foundation for others to operate on. This transformation signals a major shift in how capitalist firms operate and how they interact with the rest of the economy: the emergence of 'platform capitalism'. This book critically examines these new business forms, tracing their genesis from the long downturn of the 1970s to the boom and bust of the 1990s and the aftershocks of the 2008 crisis. It shows how the fundamental foundations of the economy are rapidly being carved up among a small number of monopolistic platforms, and how the platform introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to any vision of a post-capitalist future.

"UKFFFKTG","book","2016","","Space, place and global digital work","","978-1-137-48086-6","","","","This volume seeks to enhance our understanding of the concepts of space and place in the study of digital work. It argues that while digital work is often presented as 'placeless', work always takes place somewhere with a certain degree of local embeddedness. Contributors to this collection address restructuring processes that bring about delocalised digital work and point out limitations to dislocation inherent in the work itself, and the social relations or the physical artefacts involved. Exploring the dynamics of global value chains and shifts in the international division of labour, this book explores the impact these have on employment and working conditions, workers' agency in shaping and coping with changes in work, and the new competencies needed in virtual organisational environments. Combining different disciplinary perspectives, the volume teases out the spatial aspects of digital work at different scales ranging from team level to that of global production networks","2016","2020-01-22 15:38:26","2020-01-22 15:38:43","","","256","","","","","","Dynamics of virtual work","","","","Palgrave Macmillan","London","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","HC79.I55 S674 2016","OCLC: ocn944474141","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\CUNZJJBU\Flecker - 2016 - Space, place and global digital work.pdf","","гиг-экономика; география","Information technology; Social sciences; Sociology; Economics; Equality; Social structure; Sociological aspects; Work; Work environment","Flecker, Jörg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But most of the<br />available evidence on digital economies remains focused on high-income<br />economies, with relatively little known about the implications of the digital<br />for those at the global margins.</p> <p><em>Such a reflexion, that a new technology is going to erase the distance is not new, something similar happened with the invention of telegraph.</em></p> <p>Margins are defined as margins, after all, because they are not in a center.<br />But if technologies can change positionalities by allowing us all to interconnect,<br />irrespective of where we are, they can bring the margins to the center<br />and the center to the margins.</p> <p>Digital enterprises, digital entrepreneurs, and digital workers from every<br />corner of the world might all be able to connect using the same network,<br />but this does not necessarily mean that they can all use it to alter their<br />positionalities or level playing fields in the same ways, leading to a “thintegration”<br />into global economies that does little to change positions of economic<br />dependency (Carmody 2013).</p> <p>The authors of the <strong>World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends</strong><br />argue that using digital technologies at global margins confers massive<br />benefits but that those benefits are highly unevenly distributed.</p> <p><em>To sum up, this volume is focused on the consequences of digital labour for local economies and societies.</em></p> <p><strong>Hernan Galperin and</strong><br /><strong>Catrihel Greppi,</strong> in chapter 12, also examine digital jobs that can, in theory,<br />be done from anywhere. Using data from one of the world’s largest<br />online labor platforms, they show that even though much digital work can<br />be done from anywhere, workers outside global economic cores can suffer<br />from discrimination.

"QN983M2F","journalArticle","2014","Lehdonvirta, Vili","Online labour markets","","","","","","The Internet has long been predicted to become a shortcut that allows workers to work for any employer regardless of their location. To some extent this has now become a reality, with the rise of “online labour markets” that bring together buyers and sellers of intangible knowledge and service work from around the world. Practical considerations such as language and time zone differences can be expected to shape those markets, but a long tradition of research in international business finds that foreignness per se can also be a liability. In this paper, we use data from the largest global online marketplace to examine the degree to which geography still matters, not just for practical matters but also in terms of a persisting perception of foreignness in the online space. We find that the market is highly international, with most employers residing in rich countries and most workers in poor countries. However, workers are more likely to find work in their domestic markets. Moreover, domestic contractors get paid more than international contractors for the same type of work. Our analysis suggests that this bias against international contractors is not only due to practical factors such as time zone differences and language-based communication difficulties, but especially to what can be termed a “liability of foreignness”. We conclude that while the Internet can bridge physical distance, there are also other geographically conditioned barriers to trade that digital connectivity doesn’t necessarily address.","2014","2020-01-23 16:43:52","2020-05-19 13:07:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;""><em>Well, they hypothesize that suppliers from countries with language different to those spoken by the majority of clients on the platform would earn lower rates.

We test these propositions using transactional data from Nubelo, a large online labor platform for Spanish-speaking employers/freelance workers. The results suggest that information-related frictions long observed in traditional labor markets may be exacerbated in online platforms, resulting in worker discrimination based on country of origin. We show that, after controlling for observable workers’ characteristics and their job bids, foreign job-seekers are 42 percent less likely to win contracts from Spanish employers, which represent about two-thirds of all employers in the platform. We attribute this result to the activation of stereotypes that orient employers’ hiring decisions, in the absence of verifiable information about the quality of individual workers.

This is similar to the spatial-signaling mechanism whereby employers discriminate against job seekers from US inner cities or those living in public housing (Neckerman and Kirschenman 1991).</p> <p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;""> </p> <p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">We provide empirical evidence for this mechanism by showing that Spanish employers adjust preferences based on the amount of platform-verified information available about workers. In particular, the hiring advantage for domestic (i.e., Spanish) workers falls as more information about individual workers is available, and as employers acquire experience contracting foreign workers.

Following Autor (2001), we identify three dimensions of such change. First, search costs are significantly reduced, potentially improving matching between employers and job seekers. Second, the digitization of tasks results in more workers able to perform their tasks remotely. Third, online platforms make geographic proximity between employers and workers less relevant, potentially flattening the labor market.</p> <p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;""> Before the diffusion of the Internet and the emergence of online platforms, spatial distance benefited workers who lived near the most productive firms. This resulted in better employment opportunities and higher wages for workers in advanced economies</p> <p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"">The above argument rests on two key assumptions that deserve further examination: first, that tasks are easily codifiable and written into binding job contracts that can be monitored and enforced remotely.

Hence, we restructure and analyze the data using a survival analysis as our main analysis. For the survival analysis, we used the Cox proportional hazards model for estimation (Cox 1972).

To what extent can an economy predicated on data and value transfer from the Global South to the North be construed as “neocolonial”? Theoretical parallels with slavery, imperialism, and colonization fail to assess the historical uniqueness of new global inequalities. This article claims that the germane notion of “coloniality” (by relating to existing works at the intersection of race, gender, postcolonial, and subaltern studies) better addresses the dynamics of social exclusion and exploitation at play in Western and non-Western countries.

In this study, we benchmark the demography of an online sample from Zhubajie to nationally representative samples and replicate commonly asked attitudinal questions in national surveys. We find that online respondents differ from the general population in many respects. Yet, the differences become smaller when comparison is made with the internet users in benchmark surveys. Importantly, when predicting attitudes, our online sample with post-stratification weights is able to produce similar coefficients in most cases as these internet-active subsamples. Our study suggests that online crowdsourcing platforms can be a useful tool for subject recruitment, especially when researchers are interested in making inferences about Chinese netizens.

Conceptualizing space, place and information technology","","","","","","This article critically explores how the relations between information technologies and space and place are being conceptualized in a broad swathe of recent writings and discourses on the geographies of `cyberspace' and information technologies. After analysing the powerful role of spatial and territorial metaphors in anchoring current discourses about information technologies and society, the article goes on to identify three broad, dominating perspectives. These I label the perspective of `substitution and transcendence' (dominated by technological Utopianists), the `co-evolution' perspective (drawing from political economy and cultural studies) and the `recombination' perspective (derived from recent work in actor-network theory). The discussion turns to each in turn, extracting the geographical dimensions and implications of each. The article concludes by considering the implications of the discussion for spatial treatments of society± technology relations and for broader debates about the nature of space and place.","","2020-01-24 08:37:06","2020-01-24 08:38:39","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IZJRUG7T\Graham - The end of geography or the explosion of place Co.pdf","","гиг-экономика; география","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The report’s central question is whether online gig work has any development potentials at the world’s economic margins.1 Its motive is to help platform operators to improve their positive impact, to help workers to take action to improve their situations, and to prompt policy makers and stakeholders interested in online gig work to revisit regulation as it applies to workers, clients, and platforms in their respective countries.</p>","2017","2020-01-24 10:55:12","2020-01-24 10:55:12","2020-01-24 10:55:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\E9NMT3HL\Graham et al. - 2017 - The Risks and Rewards of Online Gig Work At the Gl.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KHELAWU4\uuid8c791d5a-e3a5-4a59-9b93-fbabea881554.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider the extent to which platforms relax the tendencies towards the spatial clustering evident in the culture industries through an analysis of two practices: Kickstarter’s ‘curated projects’ and ‘badged projects’, which provide some projects with additional promotion. We find that both types of recommended projects tend to cluster in cultural hubs and that they enjoy higher levels of funding than successful projects in general. Rather than relaxing physical constraints on cultural production, Internet platforms reinforce them.

Because crowdwork is performed online, an infinite number of workers and clients are often spread over large geographic distances (De Stefano, 2016; see also: Scholz, 2017). On the other hand, what De Stefano calls ‘work-on demand via apps’,3 is platform-facilitated yet place-based and geographically-limited work.

Using ethnographic evidence from remote gig economy workers in North America, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, we argue that labour platforms reduce the risk of false self-employment in terms of the worker-client relationship. However, in doing so, they create new forms of worker dependency on the platforms themselves. We term this relationship ‘platform labour’, and demonstrate that it entails a ‘structured antagonism’ which manifests as perceived conflicts over platform fees, pay rates, and lack of worker voice. This creates desires for representation, greater voice and even unionisation towards the platform, while retaining entrepreneurial attitudes towards clients. By refocusing industrial relations on structured antagonism instead of the employment relationship we can understand conflict, protest and organising in new and diverse forms of work.","2019-03-05","2020-02-05 07:35:43","2020-02-05 07:35:43","2020-02-05 07:35:43","","","","","","","Platform Labour and Structured Antagonism","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\393NW6Y4\papers.html","","","technology; Employee voice; flexibility; industrial relations; trade unions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3357804","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using cluster analysis on representative data from across 12 European countries, we determine five distinct types of labour-a­ctivists, ranging from those opposed to any forms of collective action to those enthusiastic to organise and correct perceived wrongs.

Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself.

Rather than side-tracking into debates as to what exactly constitutes crowdwork, the purpose of the typology is to highlight commonalities rather than distinctions, enabling connections across areas.

The regimented nature of factory work and life in an industrial community provided the material basis for collective action and for the shared identity required to support it. But is this still true of the mechanisms of twenty-first century informational capitalism? Castells notes that in informational capitalism, ‘[t]he work process is globally integrated, but labour tends to be locally fragmented’ (Castells 2000: 18). The exploitation of global wage, skill, and regulatory differentials means that workers are often physically, temporally, and administratively detached and desynchronised from each other (Ashford et al. 2007). In the extreme case, coordination of workers’ efforts is achieved algorithmically, that is, by automated data and rule based decision making (O’Reilly 2013), leaving no opportunity for human-to-human communication. Under such dispersal and disconnection, it would seem difficult for a common identity, let alone effective organisation, to arise among workers.","2016","2020-02-05 06:58:26","2020-02-05 06:58:26","2020-02-05 06:58:26","53-80","","","","","","Algorithms that Divide and Unite","Dynamics of Virtual Work","","","","Palgrave Macmillan UK","London","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1057/978-1-137-48087-3_4","<p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Castells notes that in informational capitalism, ‘[t]he work process is globally integrated, but labour tends to be locally fragmented’ (Castells 2000: 18).</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> In the extreme case, coordination of workers’ efforts is achieved algorithmically, that is, by automated data and rule based decision making (O’Reilly 2013),</span></p>","","","","Class Identity; Collective Action; Collective Bargaining; Online Community; Organisational Identity","Flecker, Jörg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It’s a situation that we increasingly take for granted in our digital era, and while it is indicative of the novelty of twenty-first-century capitalism, it is also the key to understanding its driving force: the relentless impulse to commodify our lives in every aspect.  Ursula Huws ties together disparate economic, cultural, and political phenomena of the last few decades to form a provocative narrative about the shape of the global capitalist economy at present. She examines the way that advanced information and communications technology has opened up new fields of capital accumulation: in culture and the arts, in the privatization of public services, and in the commodification of human sociality by way of mobile devices and social networking. These trends are in turn accompanied by the dramatic restructuring of work arrangements, opening the way for new contradictions and new forms of labor solidarity and struggle around the planet. Labor in the Global Digital Economy is a forceful critique of our dizzying contemporary moment, one that goes beyond notions of mere connectedness or free-flowing information to illuminate the entrenched mechanisms of exploitation and control at the core of capitalism.","2014-12-05","2020-02-05 06:57:21","2020-02-05 06:57:21","","","208","","","","","Labor in the Global Digital Economy","","","","","NYU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: C98VCgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=C98VCgAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Business & Economics / Labor; Law / Media & the Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social capital aided recruitment, policed quality standards and ensured behavioural norms with the sort of speed and flexibility it would be hard to identify in other forms of organizing. However, it also advantaged white, middle-class men and ensured that middle-class signals came to be proxies for the most sought-after jobs. Professionals who were women, members of ethnic minorities or working class were less likely to secure jobs and were often restricted in the type of jobs they held. Significantly, the members of disadvantaged groups who succeeded did so after long periods employed by the terrestrial broadcasters or after extended apprenticeships.

Highly individualized training and work practices are an inevitable corollary.

It develops a novel critical-social perspective on digital entrepreneurship and an innovative typology of the landscape.

(2017)<br />shows that in 2016-2017 between 9 and 22 percent of workers across seven European countries<br />generated some income from gig work.</p> <p>Its growth has engendered considerable debate about its implications for regulatory and<br />protective institutions (De Stefano, 2016). Gig work threatens established forms of regulation based on<br />collective bargaining, creating legal ‘grey areas’ (Scholz, 2017: 125) where individuals are left without<br />access to social safety nets. Yet, despite recent advancements in theorising the labour process in the gig<br />economy (Gandini, 2018; Veen et al., 2019), understanding of the social relations established between<br />gig workers is still limited.</p> <p>In particular, the potentials, conditions and limits for the emergence of<br />solidarity and of <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">collective action among gig workers are only starting to be explored (cf. Lehdonvirta,</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">2016; Waters and Woodcock, 2017; Wood et al., 2018).</span></p> <p>Workers’ solidarity is often conceptualised as the basis from which forms of collective action within<br />and beyond the workplace can develop (Fantasia, 1988; Atzeni, 2010)</p> <p>The emergence of solidarity and<br />collective action among gig workers might have seemed unlikely, given the atomisation and spatial<br />3<br />dispersal characterising their jobs and the imbalanced power relations between workers and platforms.<br />Nonetheless, since 2016 various gig economy platforms – such as the ride-hailing app Uber or the food<br />delivery platforms Deliveroo, UberEats and Foodora - have attracted attention in several countries as<br />epicentres of labour unrest.</p> <p>The study<br />addresses two research questions. First, how does solidarity emerge among gig workers? Second, in<br />which forms does it manifest?</p> <p>While terms like the ‘platform economy’ or ‘gig economy’ encompass a multitude of platforms, the<br />most effective differentiation is between ‘crowdwork’ and ‘gig work’ platforms (De Stefano, 2016). In<br />the former, job activities are performed remotely through online platforms; in the latter workers<br />complete physical and location-specific work activities organised through apps (De Stefano, 2016).</p> <p>The operational model poses further potential constraints to the emergence of solidarity among workers.<br />Platforms seek to establish individualised employment relations. Being classified as contractors means<br />that gig workers are normally neither covered by collective bargaining nor entitled to union<br />representation. Work activity is also organised as a non-collective process: on a day-to-day basis,<br />workers interact almost exclusively with the app which allocates delivery jobs. This apparent<br />individualism, coupled with the ‘invisibilisation’ of the managerial figure (Gandini, 2018: 13) may obfuscate the “reality of collective participation in the labour process” (Martinez Lucio and Stewart,<br />1997: 53), undermining bases for collectivism. Different levels of dependence on gig work may also impede consolidation of shared identities. Recent<br />evidence (e.g. Broughton et al., 2018) suggests that gig workers may be segmented in terms of<br />attachment to the job</p> <p>In the individualised<br />and dispersed labour process of the gig economy, the ‘material’ foundations for solidarity could be<br />expected to be weaker than in traditional ‘Fordist’ workplaces characterised by workers’ physical<br />compresence, where the ‘collective’ nature of the labour process may be more easily apparent.</p> <p>In line with Fantasia (1988) and Atzeni (2010), however, this article adopts a non-deterministic<br />conceptualisation of the linkages between solidarity, the labour process and the workforce features.</p> <p>The ultimate success of collective action depends on the availability of ‘free<br />spaces’ (Polletta, 1999); workers’ framing activity (Hyman, 1999; Simms, 2012); the acquisition of consciousness through action (Fantasia, 1988); management’s counter-mobilisation strategies (Atzeni,<br />2010; O’Sullivan and Turner, 2013); and unions’ involvement (Dixon et al., 2004).</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">forms</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">of solidaristic action other than collective action are possible – including low-key, day-to-day forms of</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">conflict, resistance and mutual support (cf. Hodson, 1997; Mulholland, 2004).</span> Especially in the context<br />of ‘digital’ labour relations, new channels for expressing grievances and taking action acquire<br />importance, such as social media, online forums and messaging apps (Lee and Staples, 2018).</p> <p>I’ve been thinking, [...] how does the labour movement form when there is no shared space, like,<br />physical space? But as long as there is a shared condition, as long as two people interact at<br />some point and they find some way to communicate with each other, it doesn't matter if there is<br />no shared factory space, because there is a shared condition. Which is, the job is bullshit.</p> <p><strong>Sources of antagonism in the labour process:</strong></p> <p>Common trigger points<br />Constantly unfavorable working conditions (no sick pay or injury insurance)<br /><br /></p> <p>Lack of transparency (delivery allocation, information about incoming orders, performance metrics).</p> <p>The analysis identified two key mechanisms, common to both cases, that facilitated the emergence of<br />solidarity: overcoming individualisation and developing consciousness in action. These processes and<br />the contextual factors which prompted them are reconstructed below.</p> <p>Developing a sense of collective identity and shared interests has been identified as a key aspect for<br />emergence of workers’ solidarity (Fantasia 1988; Atzeni 2010; Simms and Dean 2015).</p> <p>overcoming individualisation was crucial<br />to develop solidarity between couriers. Two central factors enabled this: the availability of ‘free spaces’<br />and the existence and nurturing of social relations.</p> <p>The literature identifies ‘free spaces’ as settings - either physical or virtual - partly free from social<br />control of authorities that allow groups to collectively organise and challenge the status quo by offering<br />opportunities for protected interaction (Polletta, 1999).</p> <p>Virtual meeting spaces were also key to developing shared consciousness.</p> <p>In both cases, couriers involved in the protests<br />engaged in framing activity that sought to consolidate their identity as workers (Hyman, 1999,<br />Simms, 2012), to counter the platforms’ rhetoric that sought to depict couriering as a fun activity<br />done to keep fit or earn ‘beer money’, rather than as ‘real work’.</p> <p>The research further highlighted some common obstacles to the reach and consolidation of solidarity<br />over time, arising from platforms’ deliberate managerial counter-action strategies and from features of<br />the labour process (Atzeni, 2010).</p> <p>As the initial spontaneous mobilisations morphed into longer-term campaigns for unionisation and<br />change in contractual classification, the platforms also adopted communication campaigns to dissuade<br />workers from unionising by depicting the protesters as a small minority of troublemakers</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\98LYEEIX\Tassinari and Maccarrone - 2020 - Riders on the Storm Workplace Solidarity among Gi.pdf","","","gig economy; collective action; labour process; labour relations; mobilisation; platform economy; solidarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"24DINKM6","journalArticle","","Herstade, Sverre J","Papers in Innovation Studies","","","","","","The literature on regional innovation systems emphasizes the role of the region as locus for interactive learning and knowledge exchange, stressing the importance of (geographical) proximity for innovation (Asheim and Gertler 2005). Even though the importance of extra-regional knowledge is widely acknowledged (Trippl et al. 2015), there has been only little emphasis on the particular role and the nature of global knowledge flows. The aim of this chapter is to explore the differentiated nature of global knowledge flows in regional innovation systems. We provide an overview of the different ways firms can gain access to global knowledge sources. Identified knowledge sourcing channels include international R&D collaborations, foreign direct investments, personally embedded relationships, international mobility of skilled labour, virtual communities and online platforms, and the participation in temporary clusters such as fairs, exhibitions, and conferences (Maskell et al. 2006, Aslesen and Sardo 2016). Depending on regional innovation system preconditions, firms use and combine different knowledge sourcing channels to access global knowledge. Firms in organisationally thick and diversified regional innovation systems have a geographical advantage in accessing knowledge globally, but even firms in peripheral areas can exchange knowledge worldwide, due to improved means of transport and communication at distance. Furthermore, not only multinational companies that are dominated by analytical or synthetic knowledge bases, but even small and medium sized enterprises in symbolic industries are often deeply involved in global knowledge sourcing activities. We illustrate our arguments with interview data collected among New Media firms in southern Sweden and in the Oslo Region in Norway.","","2020-03-04 18:53:14","2020-03-04 18:53:14","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NSF7K7DT\Herstade - Papers in Innovation Studies.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely due to methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of Caller Ring Back Tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely-connected and selfcontained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these sub-populations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel auto-probit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on Bramoullé et al.’s (2009) spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors.","2018-06","2020-03-04 18:56:24","2020-05-19 13:59:17","2020-03-04 18:56:24","292-314","","2","29","","Information Systems Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PQYG7K49\Zhang et al. - 2018 - On Direct vs. Indirect Peer Influence in Large Soc.pdf","","социальные сети","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Winship and Mandel's (1983) distinction between roles as classifications across social structures and positions as locations within social structures helps distinguish my endeavor from earlier work. I do not explore how dynamics differ across markets; I examine how a producer's position in the market affects the relative opportunities open to that producer in comparison to those available to its competitors</p> <p>More critical is a second view of market status as a signal of the underlying quality of a firm's products. If an actor is uncertain of the actual quality of the goods that confront her in the market, or if she is unwilling or unable to bear the search costs of investigating all the differ- ent products in the market, then the regard that other market participants have for a given producer is a fairly strong indicator of the quality of that producer's output.</p> <p>A producer's network of relations mediates the link between quality and status in two ways. First, the embeddedness of action in social rela- tions prevents contact between a producer and consumer that could po- tentially change the latter's opinion of the former.</p> <p>   Social relations also mediate between status and quality because status flows through the ""interlinkages"" between individuals and groups (Goode 1978; Blau [1964] 1989). Ties to higher-status actors enhance the prestige with which one is viewed, while ties to lower-status actors de- tract from it (Faulkner 1983). Accordingly, the formation and dissolution of social relations necessarily influence how the producer is perceived. In product markets, there are several types of ties that affect perceptions of a producer's status: exchange relations with consumers, ties to third parties associated with the market, and affiliations with other producers.</p> <p>To the extent that buyers observe not only the products and actions of other buyers, the formation and dissolution of exchange relations with prominent customers has a strong ""spillover"" effect for a producer.</p> <p>Coleman, Katz, and Menzel (1957) and Burt (1987) have shown that an individual's propensity to adopt an innovation is influenced by whether or not prominent others in that individual's network have done the same.</p> <p>Examples of interproducer ties relevant to status are joint ventures, individuals who depart from one firm to work for another, or common membership in trade associations (Benjamin 1992). In all three of these cases, <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">status flows through the linkages between market actors in the manner described by Goode</span> (1978</p> <p>Thus, there are three types of ties that serve as intermediate signals of quality: ties to prominent buyers, ties to third parties, and ties to other producers. Although this relational component to status is not necessarily inconsistent with economic conceptions of reputation (e.g., Kreps and Wilson 1982), it is equally true that this relational component has not received explicit attention in such work</p> <p>hese ties to high-status actors are not components of product quality, but are to some degree signals within the larger signal of status. The existence of such ties thus does not eradicate the link between actual quality and status; rather, such ties simply serve to further blur or loosen the relation.</p> <p>Status, thus, may ultimately be a more multifac- eted and encompassing signal than an attribute such as education or a product warranty insofar as it denotes a producer's position relative to its competitors; yet, at the same time, the linkage between status and quality is probably looser than that between quality and other signals.</p> <p>. If quality shifts were recognized immediately, then the status posi- tion would be inseparable from the present actions of the producer and, therefore, would not be analytically useful. However, the greater the decoupling, the more the status position insulates and circumscribes the producer's action and the more the producer's reputation becomes exter- nal to itself. In short, due to the loose linkage of quality and status, a niche emerges as a given constraint that the producer must confront in trying to decide upon an optimal course of action.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\I9DGL8UH\Podolny - 1993 - A Status-Based Model of Market Competition.pdf","","статус; *","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QQU3KMW9","book","1978","Weber, Max","Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology","","978-0-520-03500-3","","","","Max Weber's Economy and Society is the greatest sociological treatise written in this century. Published posthumously in Germany in the early 1920's, it has become a constitutive part of the modern sociological imagination. Economy and Society was the first strictly empirical comparison of social structures and normative orders in world-historical depth, containing the famous chapters on social action, religion, law, bureaucracy, charisma, the city, and the political community with its dimensions of class, status and power.  Economy and Status is Weber's only major treatise for an educated general public. It was meant to be a broad introduction, but in its own way it is the most demanding textbook yet written by a sociologist. The precision of its definitions, the complexity of its typologies and the wealth of its historical content make the work a continuos challenge at several levels of comprehension: for the advanced undergraduate who gropes for his sense of society, for the graduate student who must develop his own analytical skills, and for the scholar who must match wits with Weber.  When the long-awaited first complete English edition of Economy and Society was published in 1968, Arthur Stinchcombe wrote in the American Journal of Sociology: ""My answer to the question of whether people should still start their sociological intellectual biographies with Economy and Society is yes."" Reinhard Bendix noted in the American Sociological Review that the ""publication of a compete English edition of Weber's most systematic work [represents] the culmination of a cultural transmission to the American setting...It will be a study-guide and compendium for years to come for all those interested in historical sociology and comparative study.""  In a lengthy introduction, Guenther Roth traces the intellectual prehistory of Economy and Society, the gradual emergence of its dominant themes and the nature of its internal logic.  Mr. Roth is a Professor of Sociology at Columbia University. Mr. Wittich heads an economic research group at the United Nations.","1978","2020-03-08 15:18:50","2020-05-19 13:42:20","","","756","","","","","Economy and Society","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: MILOksrhgrYC","","; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Q2F2R279\Weber - 1978 - Economy and Society An Outline of Interpretive So.pdf","https://books.google.ru/books?id=MILOksrhgrYC","статус","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the model, actors reproduce status<br />hierarchies by adjusting their own status-conferring gestures according to collective attributions. These collective attributions are<br />just the aggregate of individual gestures, leading to a self-reinforcing<br />status ranking. Winner-take-all hierarchies are discouraged, however, when people prefer reciprocation of their status-conferring actions. The model therefore depicts a status ranking as an equilibrium<br />resulting from individual responses to the trade-off between social<br />influence and the distaste for making unreciprocated gestures. Analysis of the model generates several precise predictions about the<br />patterns that social networks should exhibit at equilibrium. Data<br />on interaction in task groups, friendship ratings in a fraternity, and<br />play in a set of infant quintuplets is used to show that the formal<br />theory makes unusually accurate predictions about network<br />structure.</h2> <h2><em>Social science has two broad frameworks within which to account for differentiation.</em></h2> <h2><em>The first is individual-level framework that refers to differences between individuals: the better positioned actors have features that are more salient for a given situation. The higher rewards also serve to elicit such qualities in individuals.</em><em></em></h2> <h2><em>The second approach ascribes differentiation in valued outcomes to the quality of social positions individuals occupy.</em></h2> <h2><em>The first position usually serves to justify hierarchies, while the second for moral opposition to it.</em></h2> <h2><em>Hierarchies seem to be produced and maintained through the processes that are less purposeful and less centralized than the structuralist perspective usually contemplates.</em></h2> <h2><em>Like Granovetter, Gould sees network approach as an alternative to the individualistic and structuralist perspectives.</em></h2> <h2><em>Network theoretical framework considers individual's contributions to one's position in hierarchies, but at one remove - a remove mediated by the creation of ranked social positions.</em></h2> <h2><em>The reason positions with lesser and greater values exist is that judgements about relative quality are socially influenced.</em></h2> <h2>Socially influenced judgments amplify underlying differences, so that actors who objectively rank above the mean<br />on some abstract quality dimension are overvalued while those ranking<br />below the mean are undervalued—relative to the baseline scenario, in<br />which social influence does not operate.</h2> <h2>Amplification occurs because<br />observable interactions expressing judgments of quality are also cues to<br />other actors seeking guidance for their own judgments</h2> <h2>Because status<br />positions are modeled as the expression and result of gestures of approval<br />by multiple actors, and because such gestures are precisely the sort of<br />thing sociometric data reflect, the social mechanism captured in the model<br />generates strong predictions about what kinds of sociometric structures<br />should be observed. <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Significantly, the hypotheses can be tested on social</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">network data without observing or making assumptions about the distribution of underlying actor qualities.</span></h2> <h2>There is strong evidence that subjective assessments are profoundly socially influenced.</h2> <h2><em>Observations on conformity from social psychology (Milgram) also reinforce the argument.</em></h2> <h2>In sociological<br />studies of science, it is commonly observed that prominent individuals<br />benefit—and marginal individuals suffer—from the “Matthew effect”<br />(Merton 1968; Zuckerman and Merton 1971; Cole and Cole 1973), a pattern in which contributions of apparently similar quality are evaluated<br />differentially depending on the status of the contributor</h2> <h2>This is a self-reinforcing process, that perpetuates status positions in absence of any visible reinforcement or differences in individual characteristics.</h2> <h2>If self-reinforcing attributions is the only mechanism operating, the only stable outcomes are radical equality and radical inequality.</h2> <h2>individuals face a trade-off between attaching themselves to<br />desirable alters and attaching themselves to available alters, <em>that qualifies the winner-take-all inequality</em></h2> <h2>symmetry considerations might influence the pattern of<br />attributions in groups</h2> <h2>Someone who pays less attention to you than you pay to her<br />implicitly asserts that she is superior to you in status. If you do not respond<br />by withdrawing your attention, you have implicitly agreed.</h2> <h2>The tighter your follow the existing status hierarchy in destributing your attributions, the greater the likelihood that your expression of esteem to high-status alters will be asymmetric.</h2> <h2><em>Oh, this is great.

Одним из примеров электронного рынка являются биржи удалённой работы, позволяющие самозанятым профессионалам (фрилансерам) и их заказчикам быстро и с небольшими издержками найти контрагента в любом уголке мира. Биржи удалённой работы существенно изменяют ландшафт занятости и трудовые отношения, актуализируя задачу изучения внедряемых ими контрактных практик и механизмов. При этом, как и любые другие интернет-сайты, биржи удалённой работы фиксируют огромные массивы разнообразной информации о пользователях и их действиях. Используя подобные «большие данные», мы провели исследование факторов победы в конкурсах для фрилансеров на бирже удалённой работы. Конкурс является одним из популярных механизмов отбора фрилансеров, подразумевающим открытое состязание между кандидатами по выполнению поставленной организатором конкурса (заказчиком) задачи с определением победителя и выплатой ему вознаграждения. В исследовании использованы открытые данные о конкурсах, проводившихся с ноября 2009 г. по ноябрь 2018 г. на одной из крупнейших русскоязычных бирж удалённой работы, собранные в автоматическом режиме при помощи технологии парсинга (от англ. parsing). Итоговая выборка включала 6169 конкурсов, в которых в совокупности приняли участие 335 613 человек, а число уникальных участников составило 45 174 человека. Результаты исследования свидетельствуют об отсутствии устойчивых признаков дискриминации на основании социально-демографических характеристик, а также о важной роли формализированной репутации (воплощённой в рейтингах и отзывах) и коммуникации между фрилансером и заказчиком (в форме взаимных комментариев), повышающих шансы фрилансера стать победителем в конкурсе. В статье также обсуждаются методологические проблемы, возникающие при работе с «большими данными».

Normative disembeddedness leaves workers exposed to the vagaries of the external labour market due to an absence of labour regulations and rights. It also endangers social reproduction by limiting access to healthcare and requiring workers to engage in significant unpaid ‘work-for-labour’. However, we show that these workers are also simultaneously embedded within interpersonal networks of trust, which enable the work to be completed despite the low-trust nature of the gig economy. In bringing together the concepts of normative and network embeddedness, we reconnect the two sides of Polanyi’s thinking and demonstrate the value of an integrated understanding of Polanyi’s approach to embeddedness for understanding contemporary economic transformations.","2019-10","2020-03-11 08:55:39","2020-05-26 19:12:29","2020-03-11 08:55:39","931-950","","5","53","","Sociology","Networked but Commodified","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FBE3LFSU\Wood et al. - 2019 - Networked but Commodified The (Dis)Embeddedness o.pdf","","биржи; гиг-экономика; социальные сети","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"KDHIXTV5","journalArticle","","Magee, Joe C","SOCIAL HIERARCHY: THE SELF-REINFORCING NATURE OF POWER AND STATUS","","","","","","Hierarchy is such a defining and pervasive feature of organizations that its forms and basic functions are often taken for granted in organizational research. In this chapter, we revisit some basic psychological and sociological elements of hierarchy and argue that status and power are two important and distinct bases of hierarchical differentiation. We define power and status and distinguish them from previous conceptualizations and integrate a number of different literatures to explain why status and power hierarchies tend to be self-reinforcing. Power, related to one’s control over valued resources, transforms individual psychology such that the powerful think and act in ways that lead to the retention and acquisition of power. Status, related to the respect one has in the eyes of others, generates expectations for behavior and opportunities for advancement that favor those with a prior status advantage. We also explore the role that hierarchy-enhancing belief systems play in stabilizing hierarchy from the top down and from the bottom up. Finally, we address a number of factors that we think are instrumental in explaining the conditions under which hierarchies change. Our framework suggests a number of avenues for future work on the bases, causes, and consequences of hierarchy in groups and organizations.","","2020-04-01 16:06:07","2020-05-19 13:02:17","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LNUSDNDW\Magee - SOCIAL HIERARCHY THE SELF-REINFORCING NATURE OF P.pdf","","статус","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We outline three theoretically derived predictions of how status hierarchies organize patterns of behavior to produce larger public goods.We review existing evidence relevant to two of the three hypotheses and present results from a preliminary experimental test of the third.

While reputation has been linked with a history of quality, and status has been identified as an externally assigned measure of social position, empirical studies have been highly idiosyncratic in their identification of the mechanisms used to obtain either construct. This paper attempts to rectify that gap in the literature by identifying two distinct methods used to obtain reputation and status. We argue that certification contests can be used to increase organizational reputation and tournament rituals can be used to increase organizational status.

However, prior research in economics and information sciences has focused sharply on the employer’s problem of identifying good workers rather than vice versa. This issue is especially pronounced in markets for gig work, including online labor markets, in which platforms are developing strategies to help workers identify good employers. We build a theoretical model for the value of such reputation systems and test its predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may decline to pay workers while keeping their work product and workers protect themselves using third-party reputation systems, such as Turkopticon. We ﬁnd that (1) in an experiment on worker arrival, a good reputation allows employers to operate more quickly and on a larger scale without loss to quality; (2) in an experimental audit of employers, working for good-reputation employers pays 40% higher effective wages because of faster completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3) exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is particularly important to small, good-reputation employers, which rely on the reputation system to compete for workers against more established employers.

Traditional strategic models of competitive advantage – such as the industry structure view, the resource-based view or the dynamic capabilities approach – are built on assumptions which lack validity in today’s digital environments. Digitization radically changes the very nature of products, the process of value creation and, above all, firms’ competitive environment. This study contributes to a better understanding of how firms may achieve sustained competitive advantage in this digital economy: It outlines a network-centric view which explains the competitive environment of firms being confronted with digital technology and its affordances. Based on the network-centric view, the firms may achieve competitive advantage by actively shaping the digital environment (i.e. applying a logic of effectuation) and by value co-creating of the interconnected firms in the digital environment.

However, there is still reluctance to fully acknowledge the processes of sociality that constitute self-branding practice. While the relationship between branding and the affective dynamics of social production of value fostered by the diffusion of Web 2.0 is widely acknowledged in the literature, there still seems to be a lack of understanding of the extent to which self-branding relates to social relationships in the production of socialized value for individuals. The study of selfbranding practices across digital freelance professions in the knowledge economy reveals how social media has come to represent a working tool that serves the curation of a professional image and the management of social relationships via the enactment of performative practices of sociality, which exist around a shared notion of reputation as value.

This paper argues that the observed stability of job tenure might be explained by an increasing number of shamrock organizations. This organizational form has three types of workers: core employees, professional freelancers, and routine workers. In such an organization, two very different career models coexist. The organization largely determines the career of the core employee, whereas the individual essentially shapes that of the professional freelancer. This paper studies extensively the career of this second group: the professional freelancer, a growing phenomenon in many developed countries but not yet the focus of many career studies. We develop a freelance career success model on basis of the intelligent career framework augmented by insights from literature on entrepreneurship. Data are from a web survey with responses from about 1600 independent professionals in the Netherlands, in combination with 51 in-depth interviews. We provide two main contributions. First, we report findings from the first large-scale quantitative study into freelance career success. Second, this study enhances our understanding of the success of the modern career by building bridges between career and entrepreneurship literatures. We conclude that the external environment in which an individual freelancer operates is the most important factor determining career success. The study therefore suggests that more work needs to be performed on the relationship between the environment and individual career success.

We measure the impact of status signals by comparing the effect of obscuring high- versus low-status author names. Our results show that name-based signals can explain up to three-quarters of the difference in publication rates between high- and low-status authors. The signaling effect disappears for a set of prescreened proposals that receive more scrutiny than a typical submission, suggesting that status signals are more important when attention is scarce (or search costs high).

Various streams of research, including those focused on social network analysis in social media, online communities, reputation systems, blogs, and multiplayer games, have discussed social status production online in ways that are diverse and incompatible. Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of fields of cultural production, we introduce the notion of an online field and associated sociological concepts to help explain how diverse types of producers and consumers of content jointly generate unique power relations online. We elaborate on what role external resources and status markers may play in shaping social dynamics in online fields. Using this unifying theory we are able to integrate previous research findings and propose an explanation of social processes behind both the similarity across UGC platforms, which all offer multiple ways of pursuing distinction through content production, as well as the differences across such platforms in terms of which distinctions matter. We elaborate what role platform design choices play in shaping which forms of distinction count and how they are pursued as well as implications these have for status gaining strategies.

In this review, we revisit some basic psychological and sociological elements of hierarchy and argue that status and power are two important yet distinct bases of hierarchical differentiation. We first define power and status and distinguish our definitions from previous conceptualizations. We then integrate a number of different literatures to explain why status and power hierarchies tend to be self‐reinforcing. Power, related to one’s control over valued resources, transforms individual psychology such that the powerful think and act in ways that lead to the retention and acquisition of power. Status, related to the respect one has in the eyes of others, generates expectations for behavior and opportunities for advancement that favor those with a prior status advantage. We also explore the role that hierarchy‐enhancing belief systems play in stabilizing hierarchy, both from the bottom up and from the top down. Finally, we address a number of factors that we think are instrumental in explaining the conditions under which hierarchies change. Our framework suggests a number of avenues for future research on the bases, causes, and consequences of hierarchy in groups and organizations.","2008-01-01","2020-05-09 20:10:42","2020-05-19 12:12:16","2020-05-09 20:10:42","351-398","","1","2","","ANNALS","8 Social Hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.aom.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Academy of Management","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GQ2JEEG6\19416520802211628.html","","статус","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YLWNIGPV","journalArticle","","Azoulay, Pierre; Stuart, Toby; Wang, Yanbo","Matthew: Effect or Fable?","","","","","","In a market context, a status effect occurs when actors are accorded differential recognition for their efforts depending on their location in a status ordering, holding constant the quality of these efforts. In practice, because it is very difficult to measure quality, this ceteris paribus proviso often precludes convincing empirical assessments of the magnitude of status effects. We address this problem by examining the impact of a major status-conferring prize that shifts actors’ positions in a prestige ordering. Specifically, using a precisely constructed matched sample, we estimate the effect of a scientist becoming a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator (HHMI) on citations to articles the scientist published before the prize was awarded. We do find evidence of a post-appointment citation boost, but the effect is small and limited to a short window of time. Consistent with theories of status, however, the effect of the prize is significantly larger when there is uncertainty about article quality, and when prize-winners are of (relatively) low status at the time of election to HHMI.","","2020-05-11 14:35:03","2020-05-19 12:09:50","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LXRS9K65\Azoulay и др. - Matthew Effect or Fable.pdf","","статус","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lin argues that reputation is an indicator for<br />social gain as the extent of favourable/unfavourable opinions about an<br />individual within a collective.</p> <p><em>According to Lin, reputation is different from prestige in that the former<br />implies class status and hierarchy, as well as from esteem, which refers<br />to a morally infused nuance of meaning.<br /></em><em></em><em></em></p> <p>The present work principles upon the idea that the possession of a<br />‘good’ reputation is the element that enables the achievement of professional<br />outcomes and income. Conceived as such, reputation becomes a<br />resource that may be mobilised and that remains with the individual, not<br />just as a perceived feature, as per Marwick’s account, rather as a capital<br />that is invested, traded or managed in a plurality of contexts.</p> <p><em>Is social capital comprised of both status and reputation?

The conception of social capital as a resource for action is one way of introducing social structure into the rational action paradigm. Three forms of social capital are examined: obligations and expectations, information channels, and social norms. The role of closure in the social structure in facilitating the first and third of these forms of social capital is described.

The findings indicate that the likelihood of investment banks’ alliance formation is positively related to the complementarity of their capabilities, as well as their status similarity. Social capital arising from banks’ direct and indirect collaborative experiences also plays a very important role in alliance formation. The number of deals given by a lead bank to a potential partner over the past three years has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the probability that the lead bank will invite the potential partner to form an alliance. Our findings indicate that status similarity and social capital have a stronger effect on alliance formation in initial public offering deals than in secondary offering deals, as the former are more uncertain than the latter. Using these findings, we discuss the role of complementarity, status similarity, and social capital in alliance formation.

We discuss the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c) the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on the surface, and call for future research to pay closer attention to these issues.","2014-07-30","2020-05-17 19:00:07","2020-05-19 11:57:32","2020-05-17 19:00:07","261-280","","1","40","","Annu.

This phenomenon – the ‘gig economy’ – is seen as the inevitable shape of things to come. In this book, Colin Crouch takes a step back and questions this logic. He shows how the idea of an employee – a stable status that involves a bundle of rights – has maintained a curious persistence. Examining the ways companies are attacking these rights, from proffering temporary work to involuntary part-time work to ‘gigging’, he reveals the paradoxes of the situation and argues that it should not and cannot continue. He goes on to propose reforms to reverse the perverse incentives that reward irresponsible employers and punish good ones, setting out an agenda for a realistic future of secure work. Crouch’s penetrating analysis will be of interest to everyone interested in the future of work, the welfare state and the gig economy.","2019-06-07","2020-05-19 20:08:29","2020-05-19 20:08:29","","","107","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=ZW-cDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But public sharing of such data can create risk of re-identifying individuals, exposing sensitive health information. Method: We describe a framework for assessing re-identification risk that includes: identifying data elements in a research dataset that overlap with external data sources, identifying small classes of records defined by unique combinations of those data elements, and considering the pattern of population overlap between the research dataset and an external source. We also describe alternative strategies for mitigating risk when the external data source can or cannot be directly examined. Results: We illustrate this framework using the example of a large database used to develop and validate models predicting suicidal behavior after an outpatient visit. We identify elements in the research dataset that might create risk and propose a specific risk mitigation strategy: deleting indicators for health system (a proxy for state of residence) and visit year. Discussion: Researchers holding health system data must balance the public health value of data sharing against the duty to protect the privacy of health system members. Specific steps can provide a useful estimate of re-identification risk and point to effective risk mitigation strategies.","2019","2020-05-28 19:48:05","2020-05-28 19:48:48","2020-05-28 19:48:05","","","1","7","","EGEMS (Wash DC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30972355 PMCID: PMC6450246","","; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IGAL7VAX\Simon et al_Assessing and Minimizing Re-identification Risk in Research Data Derived from.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6450246/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices.

"IRX6TCK4","book","2017","Granovetter, Mark","Society and Economy: Framework and Principles","","978-0-674-97521-7","","","","Society and Economy―a work of exceptional ambition by the founder of modern economic sociology―is the first full account of Mark Granovetter’s ideas about the diverse ways in which society and economy are intertwined.The economy is not a sphere separate from other human activities, Granovetter writes. It is deeply embedded in social relations and subject to the same emotions, ideas, and constraints as religion, science, politics, or law. While some actions can be understood in traditional economic terms as people working rationally toward well-defined ends, much human behavior is harder to fit into that simple framework. Actors sometimes follow social norms with a passionate faith in their appropriateness, and at other times they conform without conscious thought. They also trust others when there is no obvious reason to do so. The power individuals wield over one another can have a major impact on economic outcomes, even when that power arises from noneconomic sources.Although people depend on social norms, culture, trust, and power to solve problems, the guidance these offer is often murky and complicated. Granovetter explores how problem solvers improvise to assemble pragmatic solutions from this multitude of principles. He draws throughout on arguments from psychology, social network studies, and long-term historical and political analysis and suggests ways to maneuver back and forth among these approaches. Underlying Granovetter’s arguments is an attempt to move beyond such simple dualisms as agency/structure to a more complex and subtle appreciation of the nuances and dynamics that drive social and economic life.","2017-02-27","2020-05-31 12:22:21","2020-05-31 12:22:21","","","256","","","","","Society and Economy","","","","","Belknap Press: An Imprint of Harvard University Press","Cambridge, Massachusetts","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Society-Economy-Principles-Mark-Granovetter/dp/0674975219","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.","1973","2020-05-31 12:27:21","2020-05-31 12:27:21","2020-05-31 12:27:21","1360-1380","","6","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we study the problem of reciprocity prediction: given the characteristics of two users, we wish to determine whether the communication between them is reciprocated or not. We approach this problem using decision trees and regression models to determine good indicators of reciprocity. We extract a network based on directed @-messages sent between users on Twitter, and identify measures based on the attributes of nodes and their network neighborhoods that can be used to construct good predictors of reciprocity. Moreover, we ﬁnd that reciprocity prediction forms interesting contrasts with earlier network prediction tasks, including link prediction, as well as the inference of strengths and signs of network links.","2011-10","2020-06-03 21:11:06","2020-06-04 05:18:23","2020-06-03 21:11:06","49-56","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Boston, MA, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RL2T4B5D\Cheng и др. - 2011 - Predicting Reciprocity in Social Networks.pdf","","метод; сетевой анализ; социальные сети; *","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust (PASSAT) / 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NHWQF45E","journalArticle","","Radkevitch, Uladzimir; van Heck, Eric; Koppius, Otto","Buyer Commitment and Opportunism in the Online Market for IT Services","","","","","","Companies increasingly outsource IT-related tasks using reverse auction mechanisms embedded into online marketplaces. However, a considerable proportion of auctions at these marketplaces do not result in a contract between buyer and supplier. Extant literature mostly refers to costly bidding and bid evaluation to explain this phenomenon. Another possible explanation is that because of the low entry barriers, buyers with a low commitment to exchange can use the marketplace solely for information gathering purposes such as price benchmarking and obtaining free consultations, having little or no intention to contract a supplier. We test this explanation by looking at how different types of costs incurred by the buyer during the sourcing process, are related to the outcome of reverse auctions in terms of contract award.

However, a considerable proportion of auctions at these marketplaces do not result in a contract between buyer and supplier. Extant literature mostly refers to costly bidding and bid evaluation to explain this phenomenon. Another possible explanation is that because of the low entry barriers, buyers with a low commitment to exchange can use the marketplace solely for information gathering purposes such as price benchmarking and obtaining free consultations, having little or no intention to contract a supplier. We test this explanation by looking at how different types of costs incurred by the buyer during the sourcing process, are related to the outcome of reverse auctions in terms of contract award. We argue that higher levels of search, preparation and negotiation costs are associated with higher commitment to exchange and find that opportunistic behaviour does indeed play a part in the noncontracted projects, while committed buyers are more likely to enter into a contract with a supplier.

The exponential growth of this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this importance, limited effort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may affect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-specific traits that could influence hiring outcomes. We find that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in feminine-typed occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also find that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our findings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers.

In such markets, employers post tasks on which remote contractors work and deliver the product of their work online. As in most online marketplaces, reputation mechanisms play a very important role in facilitating transactions, since they instill trust and are often predictive of the employer’s future satisfaction. However, labor markets are usually highly heterogeneous in terms of available task categories; in such scenarios, past performance may not be an accurate signal of future performance. To account for this natural heterogeneity, in this work, we build models that predict the performance of a worker based on prior, category-specific feedback. Our models assume that each worker has a category-specific quality, which is latent and not directly observable; what is observable, though, is the set of feedback ratings of the worker and of other contractors with similar work histories. Based on this information, we provide a series of models of increasing complexity that successfully estimate the worker’s quality. We start by building a binomial model and a multinomial model under the implicit assumption that the latent qualities of the workers are static. Next, we remove this assumption, and we build linear dynamic systems that capture the evolution of these latent qualities over time. We evaluate our models on a large corpus of over a million transactions (completed tasks) from oDesk, an online labor market with hundreds of millions of dollars in transaction volume. Our results show an improved accuracy of up to 25% compared to feedback baselines and significant improvement over the commonly used collaborative filtering approach. Our study clearly illustrates that reputation systems should present different reputation scores, depending on the context in which the worker has been previously evaluated and the job for which the worker is applying.This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.","2015-07-09","2020-06-06 11:07:24","2020-06-06 11:07:37","2020-06-06 11:07:24","1687-1706","","6","62","","Management Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","<p>Reputation systems provide signals about the past<br />performance of workers (Dellarocas 2003).</p> <p>it is rational to assume that employers, who<br />have limited knowledge of the skills and abilities of<br />a remote contractor, often consult the history of past<br />transactions to better understand whether a contractor<br />is qualified and suitable for the task at hand.</p> <p>Here is some good review on the online reputation systems</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Finally, Adamic et al.

This research practice is likely to increase. Is this appropriate? Is this legal? Such commercial web sites are maintained to achieve business objectives; research access uses site resources for other purposes. Web site administrators may, therefore, deem academic data collection inappropriate. Is there a process to make research access more open and acceptable to web site owners and administrators? These are significant issues. This article clarifies the problems and suggests possible approaches to handle the issues with sensitivity and openness. Research access to commercial web sites may be manual (using a standard web browser) or automated (using automated data collection agents). These approaches have different effects on web sites. Researchers using manual access tend to make a limited number of page requests because manual access is costly to perform. Researchers using automated access methods can request large numbers of pages at a low cost. Therefore, web site administrators tend to view manual access and automated access very differently. Because of the number of accesses and the nonbusiness purpose, automated research requests for data are sometimes blocked by site administration using a variety of means (both technological and legal). This paper details the pertinent legal issues including trespass, copyright violation, and breech of contract. It also explains the nature of express and implied consent by site administration for research access. Based on the issues presented, guidelines for researchers are proposed to reduce objections to research activities, to facilitate communication with web site administration, and to achieve express or implied consent. These include notification to web site administration of intended automated research activity, description of the research project posted as a web page, and clear identification of automated requests for web pages. In order to encourage good research practices with respect to automated data collection, suggestions are made with respect to disclosing methods used in research papers and for self regulation by academic associations.","2006","2020-06-06 11:00:33","2020-06-06 11:02:21","2020-06-06 11:00:33","599-610","","3","30","","","Academic Data Collection in Electronic Environments","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota","","","","парсинг; право; этика","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By analyzing a detailed transactional data set with more than 1,800,000 bids corresponding to 270,000 projects posted between 2001 and 2010 in a leading online intermediary for software development services, we empirically study the effects of the reputation system on market outcomes. We consider both a structured measure summarized in a numerical reputation score and an unstructured measure based on the verbal praise left by previous buyers, which we encode using text mining techniques. We find that buyers trade off reputation (both structured and unstructured) and price and are willing to accept higher bids posted by more reputable bidders. Sellers also respond to changes in their own reputation through three different channels. They increase their bids with their reputation score (price effect) but primarily use a superior reputation to increase their probability of being selected (volume effect) as opposed to increasing their bid prices. Negative shocks in seller reputation are associated to an increase in the probability of seller exit (exit effect), but this effect is moderated by the investment that the seller has made in the site. We conclude that participants in this market are very responsive to the numerical reputation score and also to the unstructured reputational information, which behaves in a similar way to the structured numerical reputation score but provides complementary information.","2014-10-29","2020-06-06 10:51:40","2020-06-06 10:52:15","2020-06-06 10:51:39","865-886","","4","25","","Information Systems Research","Doing Business with Strangers","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2SBUY6US\isre.2014.html","","биржи; репутация","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer—for example, involving reference checks, financial audits, and on-site visits. The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i.e., the contract payment plus qualification costs. Although suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (prequalification), we allow the manufacturer to delay all or part of the qualification until after the auction (postqualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis, we analytically explore the trade-offs between varying levels of pre- and postqualification.

In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process.

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.","","2020-06-10 07:25:34","2020-06-10 07:25:34","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Адекватное описание точности решения</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IIJHQT4B\Hutto and Gilbert - VADER A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentime.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most crucial tasks that should be carried out is document representation using word embedding and Rule-Based methodologies. As a result, this, along with their modeling methods, has become an essential step to improve neural language processing for text classification. In this paper, a systematic mapping study is a way to survey all the primary studies on word embedding to rule-based and machine learning of automatic text classification. The search procedure identifies 20 articles as relevant to answer our research questions. This study maps what is currently known about word embedding in rule-based text classification (TC). The result shows that the research is concentrated on some main areas, mainly in social sciences, shopping products classification, digital libraries, and spam filtering. The present paper contributes to the available literature by summarizing all research in the field of TC and it can be beneficial to other researchers and specialists in order to sort information.","2018","2020-06-10 07:57:43","2020-06-10 07:57:43","","13","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\949VY82M\TemJournalNovember2018_902_914.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they often do not have the right data, or the data is problematic or difficult to inform strategies to improve services and system processes. Considerable resources are required to read and code these text data. Data science and text mining offer potentially efficient and cost-effective strategies for maximizing the value of these data. Objective The current study tests the feasibility of using text mining for extracting information from unstructured text to better understand substance-related problems among families investigated for abuse or neglect. Method A state child welfare agency provided written summaries from investigations of child abuse and neglect. Expert human reviewers coded 2956 investigation summaries based on whether the caseworker observed a substance-related problem. These coded documents were used to develop, train, and validate computer models that could perform the coding on an automated basis. Results A set of computer models achieved greater than 90% accuracy when judged against expert human reviewers. Fleiss kappa estimates among computer models and expert human reviewers exceeded .80, indicating that expert human reviewer ratings are exchangeable with the computer models. Conclusion These results provide compelling evidence that text mining procedures can be a cost-effective and efficient solution for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

We find that approximately 8% of workers perceive their job as socially useless, while another 17% are doubtful about the usefulness of their job. There are sizeable differences between countries, sectors, occupations, and age groups, but no trend over time.

Navalny has been actively engaging with his audience through social media and online platforms; however, some media continue to ignore the politician, practically not covering his activities. The article analyses the intensity and sentiment of the media coverage of Navalny based on data from Medialogia. It is concluded that the media in general do cover the politician’s activities and attempts to deliberately ignore news about him are only made by TV stations. However, news about Navalny is often negative. While blogs offer a more positive outlook on the politician’s activities than do the other types of media that the article considers, the majority of the coverage of Navalny in Russian media is of a critical nature. In addition, an analysis of positive and negative news in various types of media suggests that the way the politician’s activities are covered primarily involves not information about what he did or did not do but rather the various media interpretations of these actions.","2019-12","2020-06-15 20:02:28","2020-06-15 20:02:29","2020-06-15 20:02:28","312-326","","4","22","","International Area Studies Review","To cover or not to cover","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3SMG3AAA\Kazun - 2019 - To cover or not to cover Alexei Navalny in Russia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that ties between the tragedy and a network of other acute issues are more important than objective circumstances, such as the number of victims or the geography of the event. The context in which the events were examined led to greater attention to the killing of the ambassador and less attention to the surrogate alcohol poisoning.

In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students' final performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classification algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle's module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a first-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classification algorithms have been used and compared versus classification via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a final prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classification for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students' messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classification accuracy.","2013-10-01","2020-06-16 07:46:13","2020-06-16 07:46:13","2020-06-16 07:46:13","458-472","","","68","","Computers & Education","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KDXFMYYS\Romero et al. - 2013 - Predicting students' final performance from partic.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3RTGTXLD\S0360131513001607.html","","","Asynchronous discussion forums; Data mining; Distance education and telelearning; Predicting performance; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MOOCs generally enriched by discussion forums to provide interactions among students, professors, and teaching assistants. MOOC discussion forum posts provide feedback regarding the students' learning processes, social interactions, and concerns. The purpose of our research is to present a document-clustering model on MOOC discussion forum posts based on weighted word embeddings and clustering to identify question topics on discussion posts. In this study, four word-embedding schemes (namely, word2vec, fastText, global vectors, and Doc2vec), four weighting functions (i.e., term frequency-inverse document frequency [IDF], IDF, smoothed IDF, and subsampling function), and four clustering algorithms (i.e., K-means, K-means++, self-organizing maps, and divisive analysis clustering algorithm) for document clustering and topic modeling on MOOC discussion forum posts have been evaluated. Twenty different feature representations obtained from word-embedding schemes and weighting functions have been obtained. The feature representation schemes have been evaluated in conjunction with four clustering methods. For the evaluation task, the empirical results for the latent Dirichlet allocation have been also included. The empirical results in terms of adjusted rand index, normalized mutual information, and adjusted mutual information indicate that weighted word-embedding schemes combined with clustering algorithms outperform the conventional schemes.","","2020-06-16 11:05:52","2020-06-16 11:10:50","2020-06-16 11:05:52","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cae.22252","<p><span style=""left: 322.205px; top: 1100.78px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.05208);"">The main techniques</span><span style=""left: 77.4817px; top: 1122.32px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.1456);"">of EDM include classification, clustering, visual data</span><span style=""left: 77.4817px; top: 1143.96px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.0651);"">mining, statistics, association rule mining, regression, <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">se-</span></span><span style=""left: 77.4817px; top: 1165.5px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.08418);""><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">quential pattern mining,</span> and text mining [</span></p> <p><span style=""left: 77.4817px; top: 1165.5px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.08418);""><span style=""left: 574.43px; top: 435.045px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.06679);"">To process text documents with conventional</span><span style=""left: 574.43px; top: 459.279px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.0859);"">clustering algorithms, text corpus has been generally re-</span><span style=""left: 574.43px; top: 483.408px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.12069);"">presented as a feature matrix, either obtained based on</span><span style=""left: 574.43px; top: 507.538px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.0632);"">term frequency, term presence, or term frequency</span><span style=""left: 965.1402757546666px; top: 502.07015107199993px; font-size: 18.596853333333332px; font-family: sans-serif;"">‐</span><span style=""left: 970.961px; top: 507.538px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.05451);"">inverse</span><span style=""left: 574.43px; top: 531.771px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.11639);"">document frequency (TF</span><span style=""left: 780.8975304106665px; top: 526.3037106506665px; font-size: 18.596853333333332px; font-family: sans-serif;"">‐</span><span style=""left: 786.718px; top: 531.771px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.12633);"">IDF) weighting scheme.</span></span></p> <p><span style=""left: 77.4817px; top: 1165.5px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.08418);""><span style=""left: 786.718px; top: 531.771px; font-size: 18.5969px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.12633);""><span style=""left: 993.562px; top: 939.25px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.11419);"">Recent empirical</span><span style=""left: 656.489px; top: 966.945px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.10362);"">analysis on topic modeling indicates that the utilization</span><span style=""left: 656.489px; top: 994.52px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.06842);"">of neural language models in conjunction with clustering</span><span style=""left: 656.489px; top: 1022.22px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.16803);"">methods can outperform the conventional clustering</span><span style=""left: 656.489px; top: 1049.79px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.07469);"">schemes [</span><span style=""left: 747.197px; top: 1049.79px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(0.989389);"">32</span><span style=""left: 768.242px; top: 1049.79px; font-size: 21.2535px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.0164);"">].</span></span></span></p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PUTRH5LC\Onan and Toçoğlu - Weighted word embeddings and clustering-based iden.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\W23CI2VE\cae.html","","text mining","discussion forums; document clustering; massive online open courses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we use the network agenda-setting theory to analyze how these tragedies were covered by different types of mass media. We show that ties between the tragedy and a network of other acute issues are more important than objective circumstances, such as the number of victims or the geography of the event. The context in which the events were examined led to greater attention to the killing of the ambassador and less attention to the surrogate alcohol poisoning. We believe that the state can exercise indirect control over the agenda by creating a network of events that will correctly guide discussions about tragedies.","2019-07-16","2020-06-16 20:19:31","2020-06-16 20:19:31","2020-06-16 20:19:31","371-398","","3","27","","","How State-Controlled Media Can Set the Agenda on the Internet","","","","","","","en","","","","","Project MUSE","","Publisher: Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies, The George Washington University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a supporting technique, web scraping is also discussed to gather data from an online forum. After this, this chapter introduces unsupervised learning techniques to identify latent topics in documents. The combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches offers us deeper insights of the data obtained from online forums.

However, they often do not have the right data, or the data is problematic or difficult to inform strategies to improve services and system processes. Considerable resources are required to read and code these text data. Data science and text mining offer potentially efficient and cost-effective strategies for maximizing the value of these data. Objective The current study tests the feasibility of using text mining for extracting information from unstructured text to better understand substance-related problems among families investigated for abuse or neglect. Method A state child welfare agency provided written summaries from investigations of child abuse and neglect. Expert human reviewers coded 2956 investigation summaries based on whether the caseworker observed a substance-related problem. These coded documents were used to develop, train, and validate computer models that could perform the coding on an automated basis. Results A set of computer models achieved greater than 90% accuracy when judged against expert human reviewers. Fleiss kappa estimates among computer models and expert human reviewers exceeded .80, indicating that expert human reviewer ratings are exchangeable with the computer models. Conclusion These results provide compelling evidence that text mining procedures can be a cost-effective and efficient solution for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. Additional research is necessary to understand how to extract the actionable insights from these under-utilized stores of data in child welfare.","2019-12-01","2020-06-20 21:24:45","2020-06-20 21:24:45","2020-06-20 21:24:45","104180","","","98","","Child Abuse & Neglect","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F7IWUV7U\Perron et al. - 2019 - Detecting substance-related problems in narrative .pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ABRM78C7\S0145213419303576.html","","","Child welfare; Data science; Machine learning; Substance misuse; Text classification; Text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used 2014 U.S. governor’s campaign social media messages to develop models, then tested these models on a randomly selected 2016 U.S. presidential campaign social media dataset. Our classiﬁers reach .75 micro-averaged F value on training sets and .76 micro-averaged F value on test sets, suggesting that the models can be applied to classify English-language political campaign social media messages.

We survey some of the most exciting computational approaches to text analysis, highlighting both supervised methods that extend old theories to new data and unsupervised techniques that discover hidden regularities worth theorizing. We then review recent research that uses these tools to develop social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identified through heterogeneous signals within communication.

Secondly, it provides an empirical investigation of the association between individual characteristics, such as gender, age, family composition, education and motivation, and the probability of carrying out particular types of platform work, such as microtasking, creative services, software development, transportation and so on. The analysis highlights substantial heterogeneity in the attributes and motivations of the workers performing different tasks.

A multitude of trust and reputation systems have been proposed to try to cope with the problem of cheating. These systems are often evaluated by measuring their performance against simple agents that cheat randomly. Unfortunately, these systems are not often evaluated from the perspective of security—can a motivated attacker defeat the protection? Previously, it was argued that existing systems may suffer from vulnerabilities that permit effective, proﬁtable cheating despite the use of the system. In this work, we experimentally substantiate the presence of these vulnerabilities by successfully implementing and testing a number of such ‘attacks’, which consist only of sequences of sales (honest and dishonest) that can be executed in the system. This investigation also reveals two new, previously-unnoted cheating techniques. Our success in executing these attacks compellingly makes a key point: security must be a central design goal for developers of trust and reputation systems.","2009","2020-07-05 14:48:29","2020-07-05 14:48:29","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\YLFW25H5\Kerr and Cohen - 2009 - Smart Cheaters Do Prosper Defeating Trust and Rep.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Best known so far as a technology for building trust and fostering cooperation in online marketplaces, such as eBay, these mechanisms are poised to have a much wider impact on organizations. Their growing popularity has potentially important implications for a wide range of management activities such as brand building, customer acquisition and retention, product development, and quality assurance. This paper surveys our progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that these mechanisms represent. It discusses some important dimensions in which Internet-based feedback mechanisms differ from traditional word-of-mouth networks and surveys the most important issues related to their design, evaluation, and use. It provides an overview of relevant work in game theory and economics on the topic of reputation. It discusses how this body of work is being extended and combined with insights from computer science, management science, sociology, and psychology to take into consideration the special properties of online environments. Finally, it identifies opportunities that this new area presents for operations research/management science (OR/MS) research.","2003-10-01","2020-07-06 12:14:36","2020-08-19 08:01:58","2020-07-06 12:14:36","1407-1424","","10","49","","Management Science","The Digitization of Word of Mouth","","","","","","","en","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","<p><span style=""left: 526.2px; top: 1001.78px; font-size: 14.9667px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.55955);""> many tra-</span><span style=""left: 526.4px; top: 1022.82px; font-size: 15.95px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.48187);""> ditional trust-building mechanisms, such as state-</span><span style=""left: 526.2px; top: 1044.5px; font-size: 16.2833px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.44735);""> enforced contractual guarantees, tend to be less</span><span style=""left: 526.2px; top: 1067.78px; font-size: 14.9667px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.52747);""> effective in large-scale, online environments (Kollock</span><span style=""left: 526.8px; top: 1089.58px; font-size: 14.9667px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.40869);""> 199</span></p> <p>Посредством репутационных механизмов действия пользователя в отношении конкретного контрагента на платформе становятся известны остальным пользователям платформы.

In these markets, contract winners (vendors) provide clients with customized products such as computer software, business plans, and artistic designs. The products are used primarily for business purposes and require time for production after project-specific contracts are awarded. These characteristics render it unclear whether online reputation will have similar effects as in online retailing, where finished and standardized products are sold for consumption. We analyze field transaction data from a major online labor market. The analyses using matched contract samples and vendor panels consistently show that despite the governing power provided by contracts as well as the litigation and arbitration options, vendors’ online reputation can still be influential on clients. Vendors who have no reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher ratings are more likely to win subsequent bids. Importantly, however, such influences depend on the contract form that is used for a particular transaction—they are significant in output-based contracts but nonsignificant in input-based contracts. Besides extending the research on online reputation to the markets of customized production, this study shows contract form as an important boundary condition for the effectiveness of reputational information. It also provides direct managerial implications for electronic commerce in general and online labor markets in particular.This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing.","2016-12-16","2020-07-07 11:50:44","2020-07-07 11:50:44","2020-07-07 11:50:43","345-359","","1","64","","Management Science","Effectiveness of Reputation in Contracting for Customized Production","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","<p>Vendors who have no reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher ratings are more<br />likely to win subsequent bids</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\T9TC3SBU\Lin et al. - 2016 - Effectiveness of Reputation in Contracting for Cus.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BHAD89WY\mnsc.2016.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to conventional approaches that view market and hierarchy as mutually exclusive control mechanisms (or as poles of a continuum), we argue that price, authority, and trust are independent and can be combined in a variety o ways. For instance, price and authority are often played off each other within firms, while trust and price are sometimes intertwined to control transactions between firms. We also identify a type of organization largely ignored in the literature: the plural form. In the plural form, organizations simultaneously operate distinct control mechanisms for the same function. For example, organizations operate franchises and company-owned units under the same trademark, and companies sometimes make and buy the same part. To understand this form, the analytic focus must move from individual transactions to the broader architecture of control mechanisms.","1989","2020-08-03 11:57:10","2020-08-03 11:59:23","","97-118","","","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UU8BJEHG\2020 - Price, Authority, and Trust From Ideal Types to P.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The marketplace itself can do more to screen or authenticate information <br />about buyers and sellers. For example, Airbnb could conduct interviews of renters and <br />hosts, or they could run background checks.

С одной стороны, интернет давно перестал быть эксклюзивной площадкой коммуникации. С другой стороны, люди испытывают потребность в гарантиях добросовестности контрагентов, а потому оценивают их на основании всех доступных характеристик - в т.ч. пол, гендер и др.

In this paper are presented ways, taking the „diamond"" model of M. Porter and are adapted to the situation of the textile market. These adaptations have outlined the main existing problems and the possible solutions that can ensure the long-term competitive advantage. Gaining a competitive advantage based on innovation, the development of production and outsourcing strategies using the ""diamond"" model of M. Porter, we can say that is one of the viable solutions for gaining competitive advantages necessary for proper European companies to face competition from countries outside Europe. As developing countries do not meet certain environmental standards or norms of European law, but in terms of product innovation and development of new materials, they do not have the necessity for technology. We conducted an analysis of the factors that play a key role in the production of textiles, representing how they are used in the favor of European companies such investments to be supplemented can be found in how these factors act on the total costs.","","2020-10-17 13:58:06","2020-10-17 13:58:06","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XMFAYG8L\Ana - THE COMPETITIVENESS OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author proceeds from the theory of immanent contradictions of cognitive capitalism formulated by Yann Moulier Boutang, Carlo Vercellone, Andre Gorz and developed in the works of other representatives of TCC: this is the contradiction between the autonomy of labor and its valorization, and the contradiction between the non-commodity nature of knowledge and strategies for its commodification. The following analysis is based on the assumption that labor organization regimes and organizational models are designed, firstly, to prevent the development of these contradictions, and secondly, to adapt to external socio-economic conditions (uncertainty, the precarization of hiring, the volatility of prices for intangible assets, crises). Due to the weak theoretical development of the problem of labor organization within the framework of the TCC, the article offers a reconstruction of the views of these authors on the problem. The paper offers two versions of the answer to the question about the organization of immaterial labor within the TCC: the version suggested by Moulier Boutang originates from the hypothesis of network coordination developed in the works of Yochai Benkler and Walter Powell, while the second version derives from the assumption of a weak structural determinacy of the actions of autonomous agents that are integrated into the value chain through the process of subjectivation. The author criticizes the given assumptions of the TCC and puts forward a number of theoretical propositions that justify the hypothesis of the transition to a Neo-Taylorist model of management of immaterial labor.","2020","2020-10-18 13:16:33","2020-10-18 13:16:33","2020-10-18 13:16:33","","","1","32","","","ПРИНУЖДЕНИЕ, КОГНИТИВНЫЙ КАПИТАЛ, СТОИМОСТЬ","","","","","","","","","","","","cyberleninka.ru","","Number: 1 Place: Россия, Москва Publisher: Федеральное государственное бюджетное образовательное учреждение высшего образования «Российская академия народного хозяйства и государственной службы при Президенте Российской Федерации»","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4R3WBN3U\prinuzhdenie-kognitivnyy-kapital-stoimost-k-voprosu-o-printsipah-upravleniya-znaniem.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Iterations start from the seed paper selection, plain snowball sampling and probabilistic topic modelling, then greedy controlled snowball sampling and analysis of the collected citation network are performed in rotation until the list of seminal papers becomes stable. The topic model is built on the base of word-word co-occurrence probability with combination of sparse symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization and principal component approximation. Experiments show that the number of topics in the model is determined in natural way and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence provides the upper bound of the cosine similarity calculated from keywords assigned by publication authors. Several citation networks are collected and analysed. The analysis shows that all networks are “small worlds” and therefore the observed saturation of the controlled snowball sampling can provide the complete set of publications in domains of interest. Experiments with KL-divergence, symmetric KL-divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence show that KL-divergence produces less connected citation network but provides better convergence of snowball iterations. Multiple runs of the sampling confirm the hypothesis that the set of seminal publications is stable with respect to variations of the seed papers. The modified main path analysis allows to distinguish the seminal papers including new publications following main stream of research. The comparison of different ranking criterion is made. It shows that Search Path Count provides better lists of seminal papers than citation index, PageRank and indegree.","2019","2020-11-15 13:42:25","2020-11-15 13:42:25","","18-42","","","","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\X2XBCUA5\Dobrovolskyi and Keberle - 2019 - On Convergence of Controlled Snowball Sampling for.pdf","","","Text mining; Citation network; Convergence; Main path analysis; Principal component analysis; Saturation; Short text document; Sparse symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization; Topic modelling","Ermolayev, Vadim; Suárez-Figueroa, Mari Carmen; Yakovyna, Vitaliy; Mayr, Heinrich C.; Nikitchenko, Mykola; Spivakovsky, Aleksander","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When mapped using standard author cocitation analysis methods based on cited name co-occurrence counts across the entire citation database, the original context of cocitation (the focal author cocited with others) is lost. The citation image of Conrad Hal Waddington, a developmental biologist and evolutionary theorist, is mapped using both cocitation and tricitation approaches over three successive decades, 1975–1984, 1985–1994, and 1995–2004. All authors are tagged with a subject ID based on a principal components analysis of the cocitation data. The cocitation analyses place Waddington in a general subject context. The tricitation PFNets bring the major themes in articles citing Waddington into clearer focus. The changing scholarly landscape in which Waddington's work is used is demonstrated by changes in the citation image author set. These changes are associated with a shift from a primary focus on the mechanisms of evolutionary change (Waddington's work on canalization/genetic assimilation) to a resurgence of interest in Waddington's early experimental embryological work. The latter is linked to the emergence of evolutionary developmental biology, an interdisciplinary research area that examines the role of organismal development in evolutionary change.","2009","2020-11-15 13:49:51","2020-11-15 13:49:51","2020-11-15 13:49:51","1301-1319","","7","60","","","Using tricitation to dissect the citation image","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/asi.21064","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8F68JUUB\asi.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mmpf package marginalizes prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods, allowing users to investigate the behavior of these learned functions, as on a lower dimensional subset of input features: partial dependence and variations thereof. This makes machine learning methods more useful in situations where accurate prediction is not the only goal, such as in the social sciences where linear models are commonly used because of their interpretability. Many methods for estimating prediction functions produce estimated functions which are not directly human-interpretable because of their complexity: for example, they may include highdimensional interactions and/or complex nonlinearities. While a learning method’s capacity to automatically learn interactions and nonlinearities is attractive when the goal is prediction, there are many cases where users want good predictions and the ability to understand how predictions depend on the features. mmpf implements general methods for interpreting prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods. These methods allow any function which generates predictions to be be interpreted. mmpf is currently used in other packages for machine learning like edarf and mlr (Jones and Linder, 2016; Bischl et al., 2016).","2018","2020-11-30 09:18:37","2020-11-30 09:18:37","2020-11-30 09:18:37","56","","1","10","","The R Journal","mmpf","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EY7KBX3I\Jones - 2018 - mmpf Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction Functions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The online meeting places of an occupational community supported workers in their responses to three challenges of contingency: limited communication with the firm, sporadic and unpredictable compensation for their work, and unclear career trajectory. Within the community, freelancers found direction and meaning for their work, built collective strategies to smooth compensation, and illuminated a pathway from amateur to expert.

This paper investigates how social support in professional crowdworking online communities affects worker engagement in micro-task crowdworking (MTCW). We know from organizational settings that social support is a central antecedent of work engagement, as it creates a sense of identification and enhances experienced meaningfulness of work, which in turn affects engagement. In MTCW this social antecedent is challenging as the work setting rarely provides workers with social support from requesters or platforms. However, workers frequently participate in professional crowdworking online communities that function as an alternative source of social support. So far, it remains unclear whether and how this type of social support contributes to crowdworker engagement. We argue that social support from professional crowdworking online communities enhances group identification among crowdworkers as well as experienced meaningfulness of doing crowdwork, thus fostering engagement. We conducted a two-wave survey with 181 micro-workers showing that affective social support in online communities enhances crowdworkers' identification and experienced meaningfulness, thereby indirectly affecting engagement in MTCW. We contribute to theory and practice on how to create positive work experiences on virtual platforms by highlighting the importance of professional online communities.","2020-12-01","2020-12-04 13:48:30","2020-12-04 13:48:30","2020-12-04 13:48:30","106482","","","113","","Computers in Human Behavior","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9NBDASND\S074756322030234X.html","","","Crowdworker engagement; Crowdworking online platforms; Experienced meaningfulness; Group identification; Professional online communities; Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Workers who used a computer at work were found less likely to be union members, and computerization of workplaces accounted for about a quarter of the decline in union density within industries; partly by changing the skill composition of industries’ workforces and partly by enhancing employers’ resistance to unions as measured by their use of unfair labor practices and decertification elections as documented by the National Labor Relations Board. The findings are explained in a new theoretical framework that specifies what computerization does to unions by (a) reshaping the way products are made and services are provided and (b) boosting a profound power shift throughout workplaces.","2019-11","2020-12-04 13:49:53","2020-12-04 13:49:53","2020-12-04 13:49:53","371-410","","4","46","","Work and Occupations","Computerization and the Decline of American Unions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KLL5646Y\Kristal - 2019 - Computerization and the Decline of American Unions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a qualitative study of six German medium-sized platforms offering a range of standardized and creative tasks, we show that platforms provide voice mechanisms, albeit in varying degrees and levels. We find that all platforms in our sample enabled crowdworkers to communicate task-related issues to ensure crowdworker availability and quality output. Five platforms proactively consulted crowdworkers on task-related issues, and two on platform-wide organisation. Differences in the ways in which voice was implemented were driven by considerations about costs, control and a crowd’s social structure, as well as by platforms’ varying interest in fair work standards. We conclude that the platforms in our sample equip crowdworkers with ‘microphones’ by letting them have a say on workflow improvements in a highly controlled and easily mutable setting, but do not provide ‘megaphones’ for co-determining or even controlling platform decisions. By connecting the literature on employee voice with platform research, our study provides a nuanced picture of how voice is technologically and organisationally enabled and constrained in non-standard, digital work contexts.","2020-06-01","2020-12-04 13:52:33","2020-12-04 13:52:33","2020-12-04 13:52:33","001872672091576","","","","","Human Relations","Microphones, not megaphones","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\H2UJMVX3\Gegenhuber et al. - 2020 - Microphones, not megaphones Functional crowdworke.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Labor trends like outsourcing and technology hide some workers, and branding and employer mandates erase others. Invisible workers who remain under-protected by wage laws include retail workers who function as walking billboards and take payment in clothing discounts or prestige; waitstaff at ÒbreastaurantsÓ who conform their bodies to a business model; and inventory stockers at grocery stores who go hungry to complete their shifts.

We focus on forms of labor that occur within formal employment relationships but are not conceptualized as work and so remain hidden from view—sometimes in the public imagination, sometimes from consumers, and sometimes from the workers themselves. When their work is erased, the workers themselves are sometimes rendered invisible as well. We ask what forces and trends are preventing employers, consumers, and employees from “seeing” the work that is done and blocking regulators and policy makers from addressing its impacts.<br />Visible labor has traditionally been defined as work that is readily identifiable and overt. It is located in a physical “workplace” and is<br />self-recognized as work by management, employees, and consumers.<br />It is typically paid, occurs in the public sphere, is directly profit<br />generating, and has historically been full-time, long-term, and state<br />regulated.</p> <p>Arlene Daniels’s (1987) article “Invisible Work” solidified and propelled the field, becoming a reference point for the social science literature. Centering on the household and voluntary work performed within it, Daniels’s article noted the gendered character of this invisible work</p> <p>We take our inspiration from Arlie Hochschild, one of the most influential theorists on the dynamics of invisible labor within the context of paid employment. Her early work uncovered how emotions become commodities for employers in the service economy, who compel workers to undergo “feeling management” to present genuine care for their clienteles (Hochschild 1983). The emotion work done by flight attendants, she explained, was a form of labor that generated significant profits for the airlines and represented a core part of the brand marketed to consumers.</p> <p>In other scholarship addressing the concept of hidden labor within the context of paid employment, invisibility has typically been associated with minimum-wage jobs or the underground economy. This implicit pairing is particularly apparent given scholarly attention to recent expansions of low-wage sectors of the labor force such as low-end service work (Ehrenreich 2010), seasonal farmwork (Griffith and Kissam 1995), and inner-city retail and fast-food work (Newman 2000). The notion of invisibility has also been widely discussed in relation to the Global South</p> <p>Expanding this focus, our analysis considers the meaning and significance of visibility across class and social hierarchies.</p> <p>Broadening the category of invisible labor matters for several reasons. First, work that is not seen is not valued, either symbolically or materially. Second, if workers themselves do not see their efforts as valuable work, they are less likely to organize, appeal for public support, or challenge their working conditions through the legal system. Even if they want to mobilize, the invisibility of their work—and in many cases, of the workers themselves—may make it difficult for them to gain political traction or support from consumers. Finally, and most crucially, if the state and legal systems do not acknowledge the labor, it will not be addressed in policy and law. A prominent theme running throughout this book is how invisible labor is often unregulated.</p> <p>We define invisible labor as activities that occur within the context of paid employment that workers perform in response to requirements (either implicit or explicit) from employers and that are crucial for workers to generate income, to obtain or retain their jobs, and to further their careers, yet are often overlooked, ignored, and/or devalued by employers, consumers, workers, and ultimately the legal system itself.</p> <p>Many useful typologies have revealed how this process operates (Nardi and Engeström 1999; Star and Strauss 1999): visible work done by invisible people (domestic workers, librarians); visible people whose labor is relegated to the background (the care work of nurses); or the hidden tasks of visible labor (like informal conversations, storytelling, and humor that may aid the work environment).</p> <p>sociologists and cultural studies theorists have urged us to understand these categories as socially constructed.</p> <p>Near this “invisible” side of the scale (but not quite at the very end) are several other cases in our volume: crowdsourced coding engineers, internationally outsourced clerical workers, migrant farmworkers, and disabled workers in sheltered workshops. Here, the workers are not visible to the consumer and sometimes are not even visible to the employer. Moreover, some are physically confined and shielded from the formal labor market.</p> <p>What is hidden in this case is not the worker herself but rather the unstated or stated requirements to achieve visibility in the right way and the labor those requirements entail.</p> <p>The majority of our cases, however, fall between these two poles. One might consider these semivisible types of labor. Either the worker or the work is unrecognized. The invisible labor may be central or peripheral to the occupation</p> <p><strong>trends propelling the invisibility of labor</strong></p> <p>First, we have seen a rise in precarious work (Ross 2009; Vosko 2006), “employment that is uncertain, unpredictable, and risky” (Kalleberg 2009: 2).</p> <p>2004). Significantly for our purposes, precarious work often contributes to the invisibility of labor.</p> <p>Second is the expansion of the service sector. The basic foundations of the economy have shifted as most of the new jobs are in service work; that is, they are jobs that involve performing a function for customers rather than producing goods.</p> <p>Third is the rise of consumerism, which has intersected in significant ways with the expansion of the service economy.</p> <p>A fourth trend is the growth of technology, communication, and networks. In what Cherry (2011) calls “virtual work” and Scholz (2013) calls “digital labor,” current technology is restructuring previous jobs and generating new types of employment. We examine how the Internet, networks, and mobile devices are transforming the foundations of where, when, and how work is performed.</p> <p>A fifth trend is globalization.</p> <p>Globalization of labor also includes trends of subcontracting and outsourcing.</p> <p>Thus labor is submerged from view on a transnational<br />scale.</p> <p>Finally, a key feature of globalization is the migration of labor. The movement of workers across borders is reshaping the labor process and which types of labor are visible within it.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">Poster (2007b) explains how firms hide the process of outsourcing and the transfer of white-collar work overseas to India by attempting to Americanize the accents, names, and settings of the workers.</span></p> <p>Cherry and Poster (chapters 4 and 5, respectively) expose the undermining effects of invisible labor for the middle class, by transforming engineering, data coding, and call centers into micro tasks, crowdsourced labor, and virtual receptionist work, some of which earns cents on the dollar.</p> <p>Exposing Invisible Labor. We begin by theorizing what counts as work and what makes work invisible, laying out some of the costs of invisibility. This introduction initiates that process by conceptualizing invisible labor. John W. Budd (chapter 2) then explains how relatively narrow conceptualizations of work in conventional thinking dictate how we recognize, remunerate, and treat work. This explanation is helpful in understanding how particular forms of work are valued and why. He argues for training the mind to think more broadly about the forms that work takes in order to enable the eye to see it.</p> <p>Much of this work occurs behind the scenes, geographically and/or temporally (Poster 2007a; Zlolniski 2006): workers telecommute from home, warehouse workers perform manual labor at Amazon.com, cooks and caterers prepare packaged food, and nighttime janitors clean offices while those who work in them sleep.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XEP3QIJR\Poster_Crain_Cherry (2016)_Introduction - conceptualizing invisible labor.pdf","https://books.google.ru/books?id=OuslDQAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Labor; Law / Labor & Employment; Political Science / Labor & Industrial Relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars have since applied this term to many types of labour, yet there is little clarity or consensus as to what ‘invisibility’ means and what mechanisms produce it. Through an in-depth analysis of this far-reaching literature, the present article seeks to reconstruct ‘invisible work’ as a more robust analytical concept. It argues that work is made invisible through three intersecting sociological mechanisms – here identified as cultural, legal and spatial mechanisms of invisibility. Though they differ in function and degree, each of these mechanisms obscures the fact that work is performed and therefore contributes to its economic devaluation. Ultimately, this revised concept of invisible work offers scholars a new analytic tool to untangle the systems that produce and reproduce disadvantage for workers.","2017-04","2020-12-06 17:31:47","2020-12-06 17:31:47","2020-12-06 17:31:47","336-351","","2","31","","Work, Employment and Society","Mechanisms of invisibility","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LX793BRL\Hatton - 2017 - Mechanisms of invisibility rethinking the concept.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Are our lives more congested with work than they used to be? Is society polarizing into groups which, on one side, have too much work and too little leisure time to spendtheir money in, and on the other have no paid work, and hence no money to pay for the goods and services they might wish to use during their leisure? Has the recent convergence in men's and women's labour market roles led to an unfair distribution of the totals of paid plus unpaid work? Theseissues, and others similar, once the preserve of a few specialist sociologists and economists, now appear daily and prominently across the news and entertainment media.Yet there is surprisingly little substantive evidence of how individuals and societies spend their time, and of how this has changed in the developed world over the recent past. This book brings together, for the first time, data gathered in some forty national scale 'time-diary' studies, fromtwenty countries, and covering the last third of the twentieth century. It examines the newly emerging political economy of time, in the light of new estimates of how time is actually spent, and of how this has changed, in the developed world.","2003","2020-12-07 12:20:01","2020-12-07 12:20:01","","","316","","","","","Changing Times","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: SCGS0dFE3iYC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=SCGS0dFE3iYC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second part of the book includes case studies of annotation projects across the spectrum of linguistic annotation types, including morpho-syntactic tagging, syntactic analyses, a range of semantic analyses (semantic roles, named entities, sentiment and opinion), time and event and spatial analyses, and discourse level analyses including discourse structure, co-reference, etc. Each case study addresses the various phases and processes discussed in the chapters of part one.","2017-06-16","2020-12-08 17:30:42","2020-12-08 17:30:42","","","1440","","","","","","","","","","Springer","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: F3koDwAAQBAJ","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\B8URDIPY\Artstein - Inter-annotator agreement.pdf; ","https://books.google.ru/books?id=F3koDwAAQBAJ","","Computers / User Interfaces; Computers / Data Processing; Computers / Databases / General; Computers / Natural Language Processing; History / General; Language Arts & Disciplines / Linguistics / General; Language Arts & Disciplines / Linguistics / Historical & Comparative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"57RUVBBJ","journalArticle","","Artstein, Ron","Inter-annotator agreement","","","","","","This chapter touches upon several issues in the calculation and assessment of inter-annotator agreement. It gives an introduction to the theory behind agreement coeﬃcients and examples of their application to linguistic annotation tasks. Speciﬁc examples explore variation in annotator performance due to heterogeneous data, complex labels, item diﬃculty, and annotator diﬀerences, showing how global agreement coeﬃcients may mask these sources of variation, and how detailed agreement studies can give insight into both the annotation process and the nature of the underlying data. The chapter also reviews recent work on using machine learning to exploit the variation among annotators and learn detailed models from which accurate labels can be inferred. I therefore advocate an approach where agreement studies are not used merely as a means to accept or reject a particular annotation scheme, but as a tool for exploring patterns in the data that are being annotated.","","2020-12-08 17:30:48","2020-12-08 17:30:48","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like ‘what to do if there is choice-based sampling?’ or ‘when to measure effects?’ can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.","2008","2020-12-08 19:05:57","2020-12-08 19:05:57","2020-12-08 19:05:57","31-72","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00527.x","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\MCZM9UA4\Caliendo and Kopeinig - 2008 - Some Practical Guidance for the Implementation of .pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PCAIY384\j.1467-6419.2007.00527.html","","","Evaluation; Implementation; Propensity score matching; Sensitivity analysis; Treatment effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our concern here, by contrast, is with error that arises during the text coding process since nearly all manifestos are coded only once by a single coder. First, we discuss reliability and misclassification in the context of hand-coded content analysis methods. Second, we report results of a coding experiment that used trained human coders to code sample manifestos provided by the CMP, allowing us to estimate the reliability of both coders and coding categories. Third, we compare our test codings to the published CMP “gold standard” codings of the test documents to assess accuracy and produce empirical estimates of a misclassification matrix for each coding category. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of coding misclassification on the CMP's most widely used index, its left-right scale. Our findings indicate that misclassification is a serious and systemic problem with the current CMP data set and coding process, suggesting the CMP scheme should be significantly simplified to address reliability issues.","2012","2020-12-22 09:17:22","2020-12-22 09:17:22","2020-12-22 09:17:22","78-91","","1","20","","Polit. anal.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FUFMC24K\Mikhaylov et al. - 2012 - Coder Reliability and Misclassification in the Hum.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sheer amount of information available is overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great strides and the cost of computing has plummeted that it has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort, and this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2) knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective methodologies.

The tricitation PFNets bring the major themes in articles citing Waddington into clearer focus. The changing scholarly landscape in which Waddington's work is used is demonstrated by changes in the citation image author set. These changes are associated with a shift from a primary focus on the mechanisms of evolutionary change (Waddington's work on canalization/genetic assimilation) to a resurgence of interest in Waddington's early experimental embryological work.

Despite this importance, limited eﬀort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may aﬀect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasiexperimental technique, we ﬁnd evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-speciﬁc traits that could inﬂuence hiring outcomes. We ﬁnd that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in femininetyped occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also ﬁnd that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our ﬁndings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers.

Our results show that online reputation is an important predictor of success only for fixed-price contracts, but not significant for times-and-materials contracts. In other words, contract forms can mitigate the typical Matthew Effect associated with online reputation systems. Contrary to popular belief, certifications do not increase the chances of winning regardless of the contract forms. Linguistic features of private communications from the vendor to the buyer also affect the chances of winning, and different dimensions have different effects when contract forms change.

Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together. We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes: conveyance and convergence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes. Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance. For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance. We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes.

Integrating two perspectives, we explore why products that span multiple categories suffer social and economic disadvantages. According to the audience-side perspective, audience members refer to established categories to make sense of products. Products that incorporate features from multiple categories are perceived to be poor fits with category expectations and less appealing than category specialists. The producerside view holds that spanning categories reduces one's ability to effectively target each category's audience, which decreases appeal to audience members. Rather than treating these as rival explanations, we propose that both processes matter and offer a systematic, integrated account of how penalties arise as a consequence of audience-side and producer-side processes. We analyze data from two dissimilar contexts, eBay auctions and U.S. feature-film projects, to test the central implications of our theory. Together, these tests provide support for our integrated approach and suggest that both processes contribute to the penalties associated with category spanning.","2009-02-01","2021-01-23 19:13:26","2021-01-23 19:13:26","2021-01-23 19:13:26","150-169","","1","74","","Am Sociol Rev","Multiple Category Memberships in Markets","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZRX4SQ8Y\Hsu et al. - 2009 - Multiple Category Memberships in Markets An Integ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Answers to this question have been mixed, with both inverted U and U-shaped relationships being argued for and found in the literature. I show how nearly identical mechanisms driving the distinctiveness-performance relationship can yield both U-shaped and inverted U-shaped effects due to differences in relative strength, rather than their countervailing nature. Incorporating distinctiveness heterogeneity, I theorize a U-shaped effect in homogeneous categories that flattens into an inverted U in heterogeneous categories. Results combining a topic model of 69,188 organizational websites with survey data from 2,279 participants in the Dutch creative industries show a U-shaped effect in homogeneous categories, flattening and then disappearing in more heterogeneous categories. How distinctiveness affects performance thus depends entirely on how distinct others are. Managerial Summary A core strategy recommendation is to be different from competitors. Recent work highlights the notion of optimal distinctiveness—being different enough to escape competition yet similar enough to be legitimate, thus yielding the highest performance. This article challenges the notion that one “optimal” level of distinctiveness exists and focuses on distinctiveness heterogeneity (representing variation in firm positions in a category) as a key contextual factor. Results from a sample of firms in the Dutch creative industries show that either being entirely different or entirely the same to competitors pays off when one's category is very homogeneous. However, being different loses its performance effects entirely when heterogeneity in firm positions is higher. Being different from competitors, therefore, no longer pays when others tend to be different, too.","2019","2021-02-14 11:24:47","2021-02-16 12:43:33","2021-02-14 11:24:47","3-27","","1","40","","","What's the value of being different when everyone is?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.2978","<p>U-shape is flattened by distinctiveness heterogeneity (Haans et al., 2016).</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FKAXTL4H\Haans - 2019 - What's the value of being different when everyone .pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SQUP8F28\smj.html","","категории","categories; creative industries; heterogeneity; optimal distinctiveness; topic modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirically, we study the U.S. console video game industry where proto-categories frequently emerge and evolve around exemplary hit games. Analyzing a proprietary database of 6,544 games comprising 78 such proto-categories, we ﬁnd that, in the early stages of proto-category emergence, conformity with the exemplar’s features is positively associated with new entrants’ sales. As a proto-category evolves, a moderate level of diﬀerentiation becomes important for enhancing sales. We also ﬁnd that this temporal dynamic is driven by the changing competitive intensity in the proto-category and strongly mediated by critics’ reviews. Moreover, the mediating eﬀect of critics’ reviews on entrant sales becomes increasingly salient with the evolution of a proto-category. Finally, we show that accounting for the inﬂuence of emerging prototypes does not diminish the explanatory power of the exemplar model we propose.

We provide a comprehensive review of this literature and situate studies on optimal distinctiveness in the broader scholarly effort to integrate institutional theory into strategic management. Our review finds that much extant research on firm-level optimal distinctiveness is grounded in the strategic balance perspective that conceptualizes conformity and competitive differentiation as a trade-off along a single organizational attribute. We argue for a renewed research agenda that draws on recent developments in institutional theory to conceptualize organizational environments as more multiplex, fragmented, and dynamic, and discuss its implications for core strategic management topics. Managerial summary: This article aims to provide managers with a more comprehensive and contemporary view of how firms can become optimally distinct—being different enough from peer firms to be competitive, but similar enough to peers to be recognizable. We aim to equip managers with an understanding of firms as complex, multidimensional entities, and encourage them to identify and orchestrate various types of strategic resources to reconcile conformity versus differentiation tensions, address the multiplicity of stakeholder expectations, and aptly modify their positioning strategies in order to succeed in dynamic environments.

Existing research highlights this tension: whereas the innovation literature suggests that spanning disciplines is beneficial because it allows scientists to see connections across fields, the categories literature suggests that spanning disciplines is penalized because the resulting research may be lower quality or confusing to place. To investigate this, we empirically distinguish production and reception effects and highlight a new production penalty: lower productivity, which may be attributable to cognitive and collaborative challenges associated with interdisciplinary research and/or hurdles in the review process. Using an innovative measure of interdisciplinary research that considers the similarity of the disciplines spanned, we document both penalties (fewer papers published) and benefits (increased citations) associated with it and show that it is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, one that partly depends on field-level interdisciplinarity.","2017-03","2021-02-14 16:34:57","2021-02-16 12:39:02","2021-02-14 16:34:57","105-139","","1","62","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Prominent but Less Productive","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZJZNCLAL\Leahey et al. - 2017 - Prominent but Less Productive The Impact of Inter.pdf","","категории","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on a unique dataset that includes a corpus of 10.24 million e-mail messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, whereas cultural fit promotes, individual attainment.

An increasing body of cultural entrepreneurship research highlights an “optimal distinctiveness” trade-off: new ventures need to be distinctive from their peers to stand out, yet distinctiveness counteracts the attainment of organizational legitimacy. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that distinctiveness necessarily counteracts the attainment of legitimacy and propose that distinctiveness can become a source of legitimacy. This proposition matters because it fundamentally alters the relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition from certain audiences. We build on these theoretical arguments to examine new ventures’ resource acquisition from crowdfunders, one of the most important audiences for new ventures.

Yet it also largely expects this ambiguity to be either temporary, or else detrimental to the survival and evolution of the category. In this study, we demonstrate and explain how, alternatively, category ambiguity can persist when multiple frames continue to be applied to a category as it progresses into maturity. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study of the case of social entrepreneurship, we examine how and under what conditions this outcome occurs. We specify two co-occurring conditions that prompt category stakeholders to shift their framing from exclusive to inclusive, enabling category ambiguity to persist. We furthermore show how the use of category frames that draw from pre-existing resonant categories supports the persistence of category ambiguity. We contribute to literature on categories by clarifying the antecedents of category evolution towards a trajectory of persistent ambiguity.","2020","2021-02-15 15:50:43","2021-02-22 08:33:21","","24","","Organization Studies","41(7)","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>the processes through which categories emerge and change,<br />and the respective consequences for organizations, fields and markets (Durand &amp; Paolella, 2013; - <em>Seems like a review?</em></p> <p>Several studies have shown that during early stages of category<br />emergence, various stakeholders construct and promote multiple (and often divergent) frames to<br />define the label and meaning of a category (McKendrick &amp; Carroll, 2001; Santos &amp; Eisenhardt,<br />2009).</p> <p>In cases where a category continues to be associated with<br />divergent frames and multiple meanings, it is expected to be gradually abandoned by stakeholders<br />(Grodal, Gotsopoulos, &amp; Suarez, 2015).</p> <p>However, in parallel, an emerging body of work has drawn attention to cases of categories that<br />survive and prosper even though no dominant frame emerges as they mature (Pontikes, 2012).</p> <p>we still lack a comprehensive understanding of when<br />and how category ambiguity emerges in the first place and, more importantly, how it persists.</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">Recent scholarship on categories has suggested that explicit attention to interests, resources and</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">framing strategies of stakeholders would benefit our understanding of the trajectory of categories</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ff9900;"">(Durand, Granqvist, &amp; Tyllström, 2017; Hiatt &amp; Carlos, 2018).</span></p> <p>We refer to categories as ‘socially constructed partitions or taxonomies that divide the social space<br />into groupings of objects that are perceived to be similar’ (Suarez, Grodal, &amp; Gotsopoulos, 2015, p.<br />438).</p> <p>Producers, also<br />termed entrepreneurs or professionals (Grodal et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2012), usually engage<br />actively in the category’s theorization and promotion (Santos &amp; Eisenhardt, 2009).</p> <p>Existing research on categories has paid considerable attention to understanding the relationships<br />between multiple categories.

Variety and Atypicality in Cultural Consumption","","","","","","We propose a synthesis of two lines of sociological research on boundary spanning in cultural production and consumption. One, research on cultural omnivorousness, analyzes choice by heterogeneous audiences facing an array of crisp cultural oﬀerings. The other, research on categories in markets, analyzes reactions by homogeneous audiences to objects that vary in the degree to which they conform to categorical codes. We develop a model of heterogeneous audiences evaluating objects that vary in typicality. This allows consideration of orientations on two dimensions of cultural preference: variety and typicality. We propose a novel analytical framework to map consumption behavior in these two dimensions. We argue that one audience type, those who value variety and typicality, are especially resistant to objects that span boundaries.

We test this<br />argument in an analysis of two large-scale datasets of reviews of films and restaurants. - <em>This is also a paper focused on audiences' properties.</em></p> <p>Categorical boundaries organize social life. Symbolic distinctions between different practices<br />and behaviors maintain social order by institutionalizing differences between the people<br />who enact them (Lamont and Molnár 2002; Bowker and Star 2000; Zerubavel 1997;<br />Douglas (1966) 2003).- <em>This is a more serious function that should not suffer from reliance on recommendation engines.</em></p> <p>novel combinations of behaviors and ideas across different cultural domains hold the<br />potential for novelty and change, they also consistently find that categorical mixing more<br />commonly receives reproach than enthusiasm (Hannan 2010; Uzzi, Mukherjee, Stringer, and<br />Jones 2013). Cultural systems therefore strongly resist change (Lieberson 2000).<strong> For cultural</strong><br /><strong>novelty to have an impact—and occasionally catalyze change—some agents must be</strong><br /><strong>tolerant to violations of category codes. Who are these audiences?</strong></p> <p>A common answer to this question explains that cultural omnivorousness—a taste for<br />a broad variety of cultural products and practices—embodies openness toward boundaryspanning<br />(Peterson 1992; Peterson and Kern 1996; Fishman and Lizardo 2013).</p> <p>Omnivores, in other words, resist cultural scripts, and therefore<br />should be expected to appreciate cultural novelty.</p> <p>Whereas a taste for variety pertains to<br />the tendency to appreciate multiple types of cultural practice, a taste for atypicality concerns<br />a preference for cultural practices that defy conventional categorical boundaries. Contra received<br />wisdom, we argue that individuals with broad cultural tastes—conventionally referred to as omnivores—are most protective of categorical boundaries and therefore least receptive<br />toward atypical cultural innovations.</p> <p>Cultural sociologists tend to<br />think of boundary-spanning through the prism of variety, the extent to which consumers<br />have a taste for a diversity of cultural types. Studies that take this approach tend to<br />treat genres as socially-constructed organizing principles that ritualize and maintain the<br />social boundaries that divide the audience segments that consume them (DiMaggio 1987;<br />Pachucki and Breiger 2010; Lizardo 2014). Audience members with a taste for genre variety<br />presumably crosscut these boundaries.</p> <p>Formulated originally by Peterson (Peterson<br />1992; Peterson and Kern 1996), the omnivore hypothesis posits that the tendency<br />to appreciate a broad variety of genres reflects socio-cultural shifts that celebrate diversity<br />and multicultural inclusion and that have rendered exclusionary cultural snobbism obsolete.</p> <p>Studies in this vein locate boundary-crossing on the audience role in the audience–<br />producer interface - <span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""><em>Omnivorousness reflects democratization, liberalization.</em></span></p> <p>Organizational sociologists, on the other hand, have focused on the other side of the<br />interface, on those who play the producer role and on the objects that they create.</p> <p>Phillips, Turco, and Zuckerman (2013) demonstrate that high<br />status<br />corporate-law firms are frowned upon when engaging in personal injury law because<br />their clients perceive such practice as inconsistent with their corporate-law identities.</p> <p>Work<br />in this vein demonstrates that audiences generally have a strong aversion for hybridity and<br />therefore tend to discount, if not outright reject, boundary-spanning actors and objects</p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">the organizational literature has generally paid attention to atypicality</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">at the cost of treating audiences as homogeneous (mostly as an analytic convenience, but</span><br /><span style=""background-color: #ffff99;"">see Pontikes (2012) and <strong>Kim and Jensen</strong> (2011) for exceptions).</span></p> <p>assumes that audience members share cultural codes and are equally cognizant of and<br />resistant to instances of code subversion. When audiences react favorably to code defiance,<br />this research conventionally attributes such a reaction to the social or reputational resources<br />available to the actor traversing cultural boundaries, not to divergent perceptions and preferences<br />among audience members (Phillips and Zuckerman 2001; Rao, Monin, and Durand<br />2005; Smith 2011; Kennedy 2008; Wry, Lounsbury, and Jennings 2013).5 In other words,<br />here we have the reverse picture: heterogeneous producers/products facing homogeneous<br />audiences.</p> <p>We propose a theoretical synthesis between these two approaches that considers heterogeneity<br />on both sides of<span style=""background-color: #ffff99;""> the audience–producer interface.</span></p> <p>We argue that pursuing and<br />appreciating variety and atypicality are different and potentially orthogonal dimensions of<br />boundary-spanning.</p> <p><em>They still treat audiences' perceptions of categories as present and constant. In Pontikes, investors are in favor of ambigousness. clients against it. I, on the other hand, would argue that categories have to be recognized, before one would penalize or favor crossing of categories' boundaries.</em><em></em></p> <p><strong>Who Rejects Boundary-Spanning Objects?</strong></p> <p>work in the<br />omnivore-studies tradition, as we noted earlier, tends to regard a taste for variety as the expression<br />of cultural open-mindedness. Johnston and Baumann (2007)</p> <p>diversity can also function as an identity claim, an enactment<br />of a social boundary. Recent research in cultural sociology interprets cultural breadth both<br />as a social resource (Erickson 1996) and as a form of cultural capital that marks elite status<br />(Khan 2012).</p> <p>If liking variety and<br />atypicality are different ways to span boundaries, as we argue, then a taste for variety does<br />not inherently imply openness to disruption of cultural codes.</p> <p><em>Okay, here we see the reference to cultural sociology that claims adherence to category purity and cultural omnivorousness (of pure classess) to work as a cultural discinction of higher social classes.</em></p> <p>H1: Appreciation for boundary-spanning (atypical) objects decreases with a taste for variety,<br />once account is taken of taste for atypicality.</p> <p>H2: Compared to the three other audience types, poly-purists are most likely to reject<br />boundary-spanning (atypical) objects.</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Z66V7PWC\Goldberg et al. - What Does It Mean to Span Cultural Boundaries Var.pdf","","категории","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, I suggest this depends on the audience evaluating the organization. Audiences that are ""market-takers"" consume or evaluate goods and use market labels to find and assess organizations; for them, ambiguous labels make organizations unclear and therefore less appealing. ""Market-makers"" are interested in redefining the market structure, and as a result, this type of audience sees the same ambiguity as flexible and therefore more appealing. I tested these ideas in a longitudinal analysis of U.S. software organizations between 1990 and 2002. As predicted, organizations that claim ambiguous labels are less appealing to consumers, an audience of market-takers, but more appealing to venture capitalists, who are market-makers. Further, when labels are ambiguous, aversion to or preference for ambiguity arises from the label itself. Identifying with multiple ambiguous labels does not make an organization even less appealing to a consumer or more appealing to a venture capitalist. Finally, all types of venture capitalists are not alike in how they react to a label's ambiguity. Independent venture capitalists act as market-makers and prefer organizations with ambiguous labels, while corporate venture capitalists act as market-takers and avoid them.","2012-03","2021-02-16 12:45:16","2021-02-16 12:46:23","2021-02-16 12:45:16","81-118","","1","57","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Two Sides of the Same Coin","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LS9ABWJK\Pontikes - 2012 - Two Sides of the Same Coin How Ambiguous Classifi.pdf","","категории","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on recent work elaborating the need to reward the greater risk associated with atypicality for it to survive, this article provides the first systematic, direct evidence for such a reward. We focus on stylistic inconsistency - mixing distinct artistic styles. In a between-subject experimental design, 183 subjects estimated the aesthetic and market value of consistent and inconsistent sets of artworks by Pablo Picasso in three status conditions. Controlling for cognitive difficulties posed by inconsistency, we show that inconsistency is rewarded (i.e., evaluated higher than consistency on aesthetic value) only at high status. Status cues guide perception so that inconsistent works by a prominent artist are given the benefit of the doubt and interpreted as a sign of creativity. The association with creativity leads to a reward for atypicality in the absence of tangible proof that it performs better than typicality.","2014-04","2021-02-16 12:45:23","2021-02-16 12:46:15","2021-02-16 12:45:23","282-302","","2","79","","Am Sociol Rev","“Notable” or “Not Able”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\E28MAIYG\Sgourev and Althuizen - 2014 - “Notable” or “Not Able” When Are Acts of Inconsis.pdf","","категории","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We theorize that when audiences have different product preferences, organizations may increase their perceived appeal to some or all audiences by making certain features more or less salient through different orderings without making substantive changes to their products or product portfolios.

Extant research focuses on how workers experience algorithmic management, while often disregarding the agency that workers exert in dealing with algorithmic management. Following a sociomateriality perspective, we investigate the practices that workers develop to comply with (assumed) mechanisms of algorithmic management on digital work platforms. Based on a systematic content analysis of 12,294 scraped comments from an online community of digital freelancers, we show how workers adopt direct and indirect “anticipatory compliance practices”, such as undervaluing their own work, staying under the radar, curtailing their outreach to clients and keeping emotions in check, in order to ensure their continued participation on the platform, which takes on the role of a shadow employer.

We further show that these practices prompt gig workers to perform<br />extra work, encompassing additional cognitive, social, and emotional work that is intertwined with<br />regular tasks.

Whereas actors in markets contract, hierarchies command, and networks collaborate, platforms co-opt assets, resources, and activities that are not part of the firm. As a distinctive organizational form, the platform model confronts a distinctive managerial challenge: how to manage value-creating activities that are undertaken on the platform but not in the firm? In a triangular geometry, platform owners co-opt the behavior of providers and users, enrolling them in the practices of algorithmic management without managerial authority having been delegated to them. Acting on their own behalf, the ratings and other activities of providers and consumers are algorithmically translated into rankings and other calculating devices that circulate through feedback loops that are twisted rather than circular. Algorithmic management involves a peculiar kind of cybernetic control because at each fold of the feedback loop accountability can be deflected and denied. Whereas Scientific Management in the early twentieth century offered a legitimating principle for the growth of a new managerial class, algorithmic management in the early twenty-first century is reshaping the managerial class. Its power asymmetries at the organizational level are related to coalitions at the regulatory level in which platform owner and investors are in alliance with platform consumers.","2021-01-29","2021-02-21 06:40:46","2021-02-21 06:40:46","2021-02-21 06:40:46","47-72 Pages","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Artwork Size: 47-72 Pages Publisher: Sociologica","<h2>SeriesInformation</h2> <p>Sociologica, Vol. 14 No. 3 (2020): Power and Control in Platform Monopoly Capitalism</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Q8ALXFWJ\Stark and Pais - 2021 - Algorithmic Management in the Platform Economy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that in the absence of organizational or professional membership, workers experience stark emotional tensions encompassing both the anxiety and fulfillment of working in precarious and personal conditions. Lacking the holding environment provided by an organization, the workers we studied endeavored to create one for themselves through cultivating connections to routines, places, people, and a broader purpose. These personal holding environments helped them manage the broad range of emotions stirred up by their precarious working lives and focus on producing work that let them define, express, and develop their selves. Thus holding environments transformed workers’ precariousness into a tolerable and even generative predicament. By clarifying the process through which people manage emotions associated with precarious and personalized work identities, and thereby render their work identities viable and their selves vital, this paper advances theorizing on the emotional underpinnings of identity work and the systems psychodynamics of independent work.","2019-03","2021-02-21 06:42:48","2021-02-21 06:42:48","2021-02-21 06:42:48","124-170","","1","64","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Agony and Ecstasy in the Gig Economy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\P4IP3CIW\Petriglieri et al. - 2019 - Agony and Ecstasy in the Gig Economy Cultivating .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NHLAA4QM","journalArticle","2020","Younkin, Peter; Kashkooli, Keyvan","Stay True to Your Roots? Category Distance, Hierarchy, and the Performance of New Entrants in the Music Industry","Organization Science","","","","","New entrants in established markets face competing recommendations over whether it is better to establish their legitimacy by conforming to type or to differentiate themselves from incumbents by proposing novel contributions. This dilemma is particularly acute in cultural markets in which demand for novelty and attention to legitimacy are both high. We draw upon research in organizational theory and entrepreneurship to hypothesize the effects of pursuing narrow or broad appeals on the performance of new entrants in the music industry. We propose that the sales of novel products vary with the distance perceived between the classes being combined and that this happens, in part, because combinations that appear to span great distances encourage consumers to adopt superordinate rather than subordinate classes (e.g., to classify and evaluate something as a “song” rather than a “country song”). Using a sample of 144 artists introduced to the public via the U.S. television program The Voice, we ﬁnd evidence of a U-shaped relationship between category distance and consumer response. Speciﬁcally, consumers reward new entrants who pursue either familiarity (i.e., nonspanning) or distinctive combinations (i.e., combine distant genres) but reject efforts that try to balance both goals. An experimental test validates that manipulating the perceived distance an artist spans inﬂuences individual evaluations of product quality and the hierarchy of categorization. Together these results provide initial evidence that distant combinations are more likely to be classiﬁed using a superordinate category, mitigating the potential confusion and legitimacybased penalties that affect middle-distance combinations.","2020","2021-02-24 13:30:14","2021-02-24 13:30:14","","25","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IJU38WTV\Younkin and Kashkooli - 2020 - Stay True to Your Roots Category Distance, Hierar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, YouTube provides video search, related video recommendation and front page highlight. The understanding of how these features drive video views is useful for creating a strategy to drive video popularity. In this paper, we perform a measurement study on data sets crawled from YouTube and ﬁnd that the related video recommendation, which recommends the videos that are related to the video a user is watching, is one of the most important view sources of videos. Despite the fact that the YouTube video search is the number one source of views in aggregation, the related video recommendation is the main source of views for the majority of the videos on YouTube. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is a strong correlation between the view count of a video and the average view count of its top referrer videos. This implies that a video has a higher chance to become popular when it is placed on the related video recommendation lists of popular videos. We also ﬁnd that the click through rate from a video to its related videos is high and the position of a video in a related video list plays a critical role in the click through rate. Finally, our evaluation of the impact of the related video recommendation system on the diversity of video views indicates that the current recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregation.","2010","2021-03-02 08:26:25","2021-03-02 08:26:26","2021-03-02 08:26:25","404","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Press","Melbourne, Australia","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VND5ERLX\Zhou et al. - 2010 - The impact of YouTube recommendation system on vid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the 10th annual conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing research has largely focused on the benefits of this oppositional categorical positioning. In this study, we explore how this strategy might be a double-edged sword. Through a longitudinal inductive study of the e-cigarette category in the U.S. (2007–2017), we develop theory on the risks of associating with an already established category. In our empirical case, we document how value-based distinctions between cigarettes and e-cigarettes became eroded and the e-cigarette category grew increasingly stigmatized. We then propose several mechanisms through which the symbolic and social boundaries between a new and an established category can weaken and the stigma associated with an existing category can become diffused, intensified, and generalized—both across organizational features and across organizations in the new category. This case allows us to investigate the processes by which strategies to legitimize categories may backfire and to consider the role that a diverse set of core and peripheral stakeholders—who enter the market with pre-existing knowledge and motivations—play in category stigmatization processes.","2021-03-01","2021-03-03 07:33:15","2021-03-03 07:33:15","2021-03-03 07:33:15","86-132","","1","66","","Administrative Science Quarterly","The Double-edged Sword of Oppositional Category Positioning","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","categories; economic sociology; new organizational forms; stigma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ideas are translated into an explicit computer simulation model of a garbage can decision process. The general implications of such a model are described in terms of five major measures on the process.

There is precedent for believing that the organization is but an extension of one or a few people, but this is a deceptively simplified approach and, in reality, makes any generalization in organizational theory enormously difficult. Modern-day organizations―manufacturing firms, hospitals, schools, armies, community agencies―are extremely complex in nature, and several strategies, employing a variety of disciplines, are needed to gain a proper understanding of them.Organizations in Action is a classic multidisciplinary study of the behavior of complex organizations as entities. Previous books on the subject focused on the behavior of people in organizational contexts, but this volume considers individual behavior only to the extent that it helps explain the nature of organizations. James D. Thompson offers ninety-five distinct propositions about the behavior of organizations, all relevant regardless of the culture in which they are found. Thompson classifies organizations according to their technologies and environments. That organizations must meet and handle uncertainty is central to his thesis.Organizations in Action is firmly grounded in concepts and theories in the social and behavioral sciences. While it does not offer an actual theory of administration, the book successfully extends the scientific base upon which any emerging administrative theory must rest. This classic work is of continuing value to organizational and management specialists, behavioral scientists, sociologists, administrators, and policymakers.","1967","2021-04-05 07:31:49","2021-05-25 19:29:41","","","222","","","","","Organizations in Action","","","","","Routledge","New Brunswick, NJ","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Organizations-Action-Administrative-Organization-Management/dp/0765809915","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a workplace studies approach, we analyse the work of museum tour guides as a salient example of workers engaged in frontline work. Our findings demonstrate the subtle and intricate nature of the embodied work of frontline workers as they ‘bring into being’ the strategic aims of an organization. We identified five elements as central to this process: (1) the situated physical context; (2) audience composition; (3) the moral order; (4) the talk, actions and gestures of the guide; and (5) the corresponding talk, actions and gestures of the audience. Drawing on these categories, we find frontline workers to demonstrate ‘interactional competence’: assessing and making use of the physical, spatial and material specifics of the context and those they are interacting with, and enlisting interactional resources to uphold a moral order that brings these others in as a working audience, encouraging them to respond in particular ways. Frontline workers thus skilfully combine language, material and bodily expressions in the flow of their work. Demonstrating these dynamics gives a more central role to material in the realization of strategy than previously recognized; demonstrates that ‘outsiders’ have an important part to play in realizing strategy; and highlights the importance of frontline workers and their skilled work in bringing strategy into being.","2015-10","2021-04-05 09:11:37","2021-04-05 09:11:38","2021-04-05 09:11:37","1285-1313","","10","36","","Organization Studies","Selling the Object of Strategy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\74EPKELV\Balogun et al. - 2015 - Selling the Object of Strategy How Frontline Work.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper argues that the observed stability of job tenure might be explained by an increasing number of shamrock organizations. This organizational form has three types of workers: core employees, professional freelancers, and routine workers. In such an organization, two very different career models coexist. The organization largely determines the career of the core employee, whereas the individual essentially shapes that of the professional freelancer. This paper studies extensively the career of this second group: the professional freelancer, a growing phenomenon in many developed countries but not yet the focus of many career studies. We develop a freelance career success model on basis of the intelligent career framework augmented by insights from literature on entrepreneurship. Data are from a web survey with responses from about 1600 independent professionals in the Netherlands, in combination with 51 in-depth interviews. We provide two main contributions. First, we report findings from the first large-scale quantitative study into freelance career success. Second, this study enhances our understanding of the success of the modern career by building bridges between career and entrepreneurship literatures. We conclude that the external environment in which an individual freelancer operates is the most important factor determining career success. The study therefore suggests that more work needs to be performed on the relationship between the environment and individual career success.

PsyCap is examined as a mediator in the relationship between mentoring and performance. Utilizing 115 mentor-protégé pairs, results support the effectiveness of the mentoring program in developing PsyCap and enhancing performance 1 year later in three cohorts of protégés, even after controlling for preprogram performance.

The methodology involved interviewing 29 participants within a sample of 17 companies, selected from the Fortune 500 listing, housing exemplary formal mentoring programs. This study revealed that top management support/involvement is a necessary component of the organizational environment, hastening success of a formal mentoring program. Other important environmental factors include a team-focused environment, an open work area with ample opportunities for interaction and a work ethic based on cross-functional operation, collaboration and networking. The study also disclosed that mentoring initiatives can succeed in organizations with several levels in the corporate hierarchy, as well as in those with ﬂattened or ﬂattening hierarchies. A comfortable atmosphere embracing open exchanges of communication among and between levels, and using multiple modes of communication (verbal, technological), is important. A discussion of the results is also presented.","2005","2021-04-23 18:45:41","2021-05-16 05:56:57","","22","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7UPMYUJX\Hegstad and Wentling - Organizational antecedents and moderators that imp.pdf","","менторство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Designed around competing theoretical frameworks, this cutting-edge book examines organizations with attention to structure and objectives, interactions among members and among organizations, the relationship between the organization and its environment and the social significance or social meaning of the organization. This volume sheds light on some of the most interesting changes and challenges facing organizations today: the integration of new media, the implementation of diversity and inclusion, and the promotion of sustainable workforce engagement. Lively and provocative, this textbook is theoretically rigorous, disciplinarily informed and representative of heterogeneity within organization studies.","2011-06-28","2021-04-25 08:01:21","2021-04-25 08:01:21","","","769","","","","","Sociology of Organizations","","","","","SAGE Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: acHnScKqPGIC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=acHnScKqPGIC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of interviews and participant observation at a time bank, a food swap, a makerspace and an open-access education site we find considerable evidence of distinguishing practices and the deployment of cultural capital, as understood by Bourdieusian theory. We augment Bourdieu with concepts from relational economic sociology, particularly Zelizer's “circuits of commerce” and “good matches,” to show how inequality is reproduced within micro-level interactions. We find that the prevalence of distinguishing practices can undermine the relations of exchange and create difficulty completing trades. This results in an inconsistency, which we call the “paradox of openness and distinction,” between actual practice and the sharing economy's widely articulated goals of openness and equity.","2016-02-01","2021-04-25 12:36:57","2021-04-25 12:36:57","2021-04-25 12:36:57","66-81","","","54","","Poetics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JB4T57GJ\S0304422X15000881.html","","","Sharing economy; Circuits of commerce; Cultural capital; Distinction; Inequality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these markets, contract winners (vendors) provide clients with customized products such as computer software, business plans, and artistic designs. The products are used primarily for business purposes and require time for production after project-speciﬁc contracts are awarded. These characteristics render it unclear whether online reputation will have similar eﬀects as in online retailing, where ﬁnished and standardized products are sold for consumption. We analyze ﬁeld transaction data from a major online labor market. The analyses using matched contract samples and vendor panels consistently show that despite the governing power provided by contracts as well as the litigation and arbitration options, vendors’ online reputation can still be inﬂuential on clients. Vendors who have no reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher ratings are more likely to win subsequent bids. Importantly, however, such inﬂuences depend on the contract form that is used for a particular transaction—they are signiﬁcant in output-based contracts but nonsigniﬁcant in input-based contracts. Besides extending the research on online reputation to the markets of customized production, this study shows contract form as an important boundary condition for the eﬀectiveness of reputational information. It also provides direct managerial implications for electronic commerce in general and online labor markets in particular.","2018-01","2021-04-30 18:54:50","2021-05-16 05:56:17","2021-04-30 18:54:50","345-359","","1","64","","Management Science","Effectiveness of Reputation in Contracting for Customized Production","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WIAFFGS7\Lin et al. - 2018 - Effectiveness of Reputation in Contracting for Cus.pdf","","reputation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product ""architecture,"" define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.","1990","2021-05-11 18:55:45","2021-05-11 18:55:45","2021-05-11 18:55:45","9-30","","1","35","","","Architectural Innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Sage Publications, Inc., Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University]","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7WECZ79C\Henderson and Clark - 1990 - Architectural Innovation The Reconfiguration of E.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter focus their critique on the basic question of how firms and industries change overtime. They marshal significant objections to the fundamental neoclassical assumptions of profit maximization and market equilibrium, which they find ineffective in the analysis of technological innovation and the dynamics of competition among firms.To replace these assumptions, they borrow from biology the concept of natural selection to construct a precise and detailed evolutionary theory of business behavior. They grant that films are motivated by profit and engage in search for ways of improving profits, but they do not consider them to be profit maximizing. Likewise, they emphasize the tendency for the more profitable firms to drive the less profitable ones out of business, but they do not focus their analysis on hypothetical states of industry equilibrium.The results of their new paradigm and analytical framework are impressive. Not only have they been able to develop more coherent and powerful models of competitive firm dynamics under conditions of growth and technological change, but their approach is compatible with findings in psychology and other social sciences. Finally, their work has important implications for welfare economics and for government policy toward industry.","1985-10-15","2021-05-11 19:34:09","2021-05-11 19:34:09","","","454","","","","","","","","","","Belknap Press: An Imprint of Harvard University Press","Cambridge, Mass.","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Theory-Economic-Change-Belknap/dp/0674272285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to the economic theory of the firm, which sees firms as profit-maximizing entities, the authors advocate a theory based on empirical observation of actual firm decision-making. Various features of firm decision-making are identified. First, firms are coalitions of participants whose individual goals may and often do conflict. How this conflict is resolved is determined by the firm's bargaining process. This process is constrained by past behavior and decisions.         Second, the authors reject the notion that firms are one-dimensional profit-maximizers in favor of a view of firms as entities with many different objectives that will accept suboptimal outcomes if they are above a minimum level. Congruent with this, a firm's search activity occurs in response to a perceived problem and is limited in scope. The effect is that firm policies will change only incrementally. Also impeding radical policy change is the fact that firms react to uncertainty using standardized decision rules. Using this theory, two computer models of business decision-making are presented and compared with actual results. These models are shown to have especially good predictive power.

A Mount Hermon and Harvard education, cut off short of the bachelor’s degree, was followed by nearly forty years in the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. His career began in the Statistical Department, took him to technical expertness in the economics of rates and administrative experience in the management of commercial operations, and culminated in the presidency of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. He was not directly involved in the Western Electric experiments conducted chiefly at the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, but his association with Elton Mayo and the latter’s colleagues at the Harvard Business School had an important bearing on his most original ideas.Barnard’s executive experience at AT&T was paralleled and followed by a career in public service unusual in his own time and hardly routine today. He was at various times president of the United Services Organization (the USO of World War II), head of the General Education Board and later president of the Rockefeller Foundation (after Raymond Fosdick and before Dean Rusk), chairman of the National Science Foundation, an assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, a consultant to the American representative in the United Nations Atomic Energy Committee, to name only some of his public interests.

A critical property of the model is that the effect on organizational fitness of the various attributes that constitute an organization's form is interactive. As a result of these interaction effects, the fitness landscape is “rugged.” An organization's form at founding has a persistent effect on its future form when there are multiple peaks in the fitness landscape, since the particular peak that an organization discovers is influenced by its starting position in the space of alternative organizational forms. Selection pressures influence the distribution of the organizational forms that emerge from the process of local adaptation. The ability of established organizations to respond to changing environments is importantly conditioned by the extent to which elements of organizational form interact in their effect on organizational fitness. Tightly coupled organizations are subject to high rates of failure in changing environments. Furthermore, successful “reorientations” are strongly associated with survival for tightly coupled organizations, but not for more loosely coupled organizations that are able to engage in effective local adaptation.","1997-07-01","2021-05-12 06:55:46","2021-05-12 06:55:46","2021-05-12 06:55:46","934-950","","7","43","","Management Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XMH4CZGV\mnsc.43.7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the labour market has become increasingly integrated into the platform economy, digital enterprises have been able to use their concentration of power to experiment with new structures of labour regulation and management. The key transformation of labour by platform enterprises is the fragmentation of labour contracts into minute by minute tasks, with noteworthy implications for our understanding of human capital investment in the digital age. As individuals are required to sell their abilities as micro-skills such as photo-tagging and copy editing, long-term human capital investments such as higher education are devalued. These long-term assets are replaced by highly volatile and short-term human capital assets such as reputation scores and platform metrics. This paper will investigate these new forms of human capital, exploring how they are held hostage by platform enterprises to lock users in and structure how labour is practiced in the new digital economy.","2020-04-15","2021-05-15 06:05:49","2021-05-16 05:56:17","2021-05-15 06:05:49","1-20","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1600910X.2020.1734847","","","","reputation","asset; digital; human capital; labour; micro-skill; Platform; reputation system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a causal model of the multiple mechanisms that sustain generalized reciprocity in an organization, drawing together disparate literatures in the social, organizational, and biological sciences. We conduct the first-ever critical test of two key mechanisms: paying it forward and rewarding reputation. These are fundamentally different grammars of organizing, either of which could sustain a system of generalized reciprocity. In an organization, paying it forward is a type of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that occurs when members of an organization help third parties because they themselves were helped. Rewarding reputation is a type of OCB that occurs when peers monitor one another, helping those who help others and refusing to help those who do not.

However, research on the boundary conditions that limit and/or enhance its effectiveness is still scarce, especially concerning one of the main misconceptions about ethical leadership, its incompatibility with effectiveness (Brown, Organ Dyn 36:140–155, 2007). Thus, the present study (a) examines the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational deviance via affective commitment to the organization, as a reflection of the quality of the employee–organization relationship and (b) proposes this relationship is conditional on the supervisor’s personal reputation for performance (i.e., the moral standards are coupled with work effectiveness). Using a sample of 224 employees and their respective supervisors from 18 organizations, we confirmed our hypotheses (moderated mediation model). Our findings suggest that ethical leadership is positively related to employees’ affective commitment to the organization, particularly when supervisor’s reputation for performance is high, which in turn is associated with decreased organizational deviance. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings conclude the paper.","2015-03-01","2021-05-15 06:48:10","2021-05-16 05:56:17","2021-05-15 06:48:10","165-176","","1","127","","J Bus Ethics","Ethical Leadership and Reputation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GMAX2WPI\Neves and Story - 2015 - Ethical Leadership and Reputation Combined Indire.pdf","","reputation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a causal model of the multiple mechanisms that sustain generalized reciprocity in an organization, drawing together disparate literatures in the social, organizational, and biological sciences. We conduct the first-ever critical test of two key mechanisms: paying it forward and rewarding reputation. These are fundamentally different grammars of organizing, either of which could sustain a system of generalized reciprocity. In an organization, paying it forward is a type of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that occurs when members of an organization help third parties because they themselves were helped. Rewarding reputation is a type of OCB that occurs when peers monitor one another, helping those who help others and refusing to help those who do not. Using behavioral data collected from members of two organizational groups over a three-month period, we found that reputational effects were strongest in the short term but decayed thereafter. Paying it forward had stronger and more lasting effects.

For example, the scale fails to distinguish between individuals who are known for being socially popular versus those who are known for being experts in their field. This study aims to address this issue by developing a multidimensional personal reputation scale. Design/methodology/approach Based on existing theory, a scale is developed and validated against existing, similar constructs. First, a panel of three academic experts who have done research on personal reputation, and also two professional experts who have rich experience in the management field, evaluated the items for face validity. Then 112 working adults were asked to rate the reputation of a co-worker. Each dimension of personal reputation was validated against an existing, similar scale (e.g. social reputation was validated against an existing “popularity” scale). Findings A multi-dimensional, personal reputation scale is presented. This measure purports that personal reputation has three dimensions: task, social and integrity. Originality/value The presented scale allows researchers to distinguish different types of reputations in the workplace. This is significant because both anecdotal evidence and empirical findings suggest that to simply assume that reputation based upon being a person of high integrity and upon being an expert at a specific task will present the same outcomes is a fallacy. To further the knowledge of personal reputation, a need exists to be able to measure the different dimensions of reputation.","2016-01-01","2021-05-15 07:01:29","2021-05-16 05:55:24","2021-05-15 07:01:29","634-649","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","","reputation","Personal reputation; Social role valorization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The toxic career model explains how dark personalities successfully climb the organizational ladder. It suggests that dark personalities can get ahead at work via self- and other-rated political skill, which results in improved job performance ratings by supervisors. We extended this mediation model by adding targets’ hierarchical organizational position. Additionally, we specified two moderating conditions that can explain how individuals with low and high honesty-humility can get ahead. First, enterprising job characteristics facilitate higher self-other agreement regarding political skill, thereby promoting the rise of individuals low in honesty-humility. Second, high honesty-humility compensates for low other-perceived political skill. We successfully tested the moderated-mediation hypotheses from the extended toxic career model in a multi-source design with 203 target-peer-supervisor triplets.","2020-04-01","2021-05-15 07:03:34","2021-05-15 07:03:34","2021-05-15 07:03:34","109792","","","156","","Personality and Individual Differences","Why dark personalities can get ahead","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Honesty-humility; Political skill; Toxic career model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, analyses of nearly decomposable systems have tended to be at a single level of analysis and have generally neglected the vertical element of nearly decomposable systems. Critical to the notion of nearly decomposable systems is the property that the details of a particular subproblem may be encapsulated and captured by more aggregate parameters and that those subproblems interact in an aggregate way. We explore these issues in reference to the role of three canonical organizational structures in facilitating adaptation in the presence of near decomposability: a traditional hierarchy in which a subordinate reports to a single boss, an autonomous form in which the subordinate does not have a direct reporting relationship, and a multiauthority structure in which the subordinate reports to multiple bosses. Despite the ubiquity and potential beneﬁts of multiauthority structures in coordinating highly interdependent tasks, our understanding of the mechanisms that determine the performance of those structures is still relatively modest. Scholars have noted conﬂicting empirical ﬁndings and have called for a more rigorous approach to study these organizational forms. To help address these issues, we develop an agent-based computational model that compares the performance of these three canonical types of organizational forms in settings characterized by diﬀerent degrees of complexity and near decomposability.","2018-04","2021-05-15 17:21:34","2021-06-29 08:27:53","2021-05-15 17:21:34","207-224","","2","29","","Organization Science","When Two Bosses Are Better Than One","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","2795914535","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 3.

While extensive literatures have modeled the course of successful discovery and pinpointed factors associated with groundbreaking discoveries, I focus on understanding why near misses occur by interviewing scientists who were very close to discovering the ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference breakthrough in biology but ultimately missed out. I identify three mechanisms rooted in paradigmatic rigidity that led to the seminal discovery being missed several times: not noticing or recognizing anomalies, actively resisting solutions, and failing to make the link between communities. These ﬁndings shed light on the process of breakthrough by clarifying that a better understanding of the mechanism behind near misses is crucial to mitigating them, saving time, and, consequently, boosting productivity and impact. They also have implications for boosting creative breakthrough performance in academic institutions and science-based ﬁrms, as well as for designing organizational research environments and guiding innovation strategy.","2017-06","2021-05-15 17:25:35","2021-06-29 08:49:58","2021-05-15 17:25:35","411-428","","3","28","","Organization Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","2610435949","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 5.

The multinational corporation arises not out of the failure of markets for the buying and selling of knowledge, but out of its superior efficiency as an organizational vehicle by which to transfer this knowledge across borders. We test the claim that firms specialize in the internal transfer of tacit knowledge by empirically examining the decision to transfer the capability to manufacture new products to wholly owned subsidiaries or to other parties. The empirical results show that the less codifiable and the harder to teach is the technology, the more likely the transfer will be to wholly owned operations. This result implies that the choice of transfer mode is determined by the efficiency of the multinational corporation in transferring knowledge relative to other firms, not relative to an abstract market transaction. The notion of the firm as specializing in the transfer and recombination of knowledge is the foundation to an evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation.","1993","2021-05-15 17:29:46","2021-06-29 08:55:24","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","3152457815","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 7.

Drawing on research from international business, political science, and international law, we argue that IIAs increase expected future cash flows, and hence the value of foreign assets, by limiting the ability of host governments to make discriminatory policy changes. However, the need for IIA protection, and the ability to benefit from it, varies with firm characteristics. Using detailed transaction-level data for sale of petroleum assets in 45 countries, we find that MNEs pay significantly higher amounts for those protected by IIAs than similar but unprotected assets, an effect moderated by the firm’s reserve size and state ownership.","2014-08","2021-05-15 17:29:53","2021-06-29 08:54:54","2021-05-15 17:29:53","649-669","","6","45","","J Int Bus Stud","Institutions sans frontières","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","1997974428","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 7.

The matching market serves as an endogenous outside option for a bargaining agent. Behavioral agents are commitment types that demand a constant portion of the surplus. The frequency of behavioral types is determined in equilibrium. Even if the frequency of behavioral types is negligible, they aﬀect the terms of trade and eﬃciency. In an unbalanced market where the entering ﬂow of one side is short, there is one-sided reputation building in bargaining, and commitment types on the short side determine the terms of trade. In a balanced market where the entering ﬂows are equal, there is twosided reputation building in bargaining, and reputation concerns lead to ineﬃciency. An equilibrium with persistent delays is constructed. The magnitude of ineﬃciency is determined by the demands of the commitment types and is independent of their frequency.

Unfortunately, despite its recognized importance, there has been very little theory and research on personal reputation in organizations published in the organizational sciences. The present paper attempts to address this need by proposing a conceptualization of personal reputation in organizations. In this conceptualization, reputation is presented as an agreed upon, collective perception by others, and involves behavior calibration derived from social comparisons with referent others that results in a deviation from the behavioral norms in one’s environment, as observed and evaluated by others. Implications of this conceptualization are discussed, as are directions for future research.","2007","2021-05-16 07:03:49","2021-05-16 08:03:38","2021-05-16 07:03:49","163-204","","","26","","Research in Personnel and Human Resources Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7NUWPFL9\Zinko et al. - 2007 - Toward a Theory of Reputation in Organizations.pdf","","reputation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate the analysis of applications such as online auctions (e.g. eBay), online shopping search engines (e.g. BizRate.com) and consumer reports, we assume that a central mechanism observes all past signals, and makes public announcements every period. The set of announcements and the mapping from observed signals to the set of announcements is called a rating system. We show that, absent reputation e¤ects, information censoring cannot improve attainable payo¤s. However, if there is an initial probability that the seller is a commitment type that plays a particular strategy every period, then there exists a …nite rating system and an equilibrium of the resulting game such that, the expected present discounted payo¤ of the seller is almost his Stackelberg payo¤ after every history. This is in contrast to Cripps, Mailath and Samuelson (2004), where it is shown that reputation e¤ects do not last forever in such games if buyers can observe all past signals.

It is proposed that individuals use personal reputations to satisfy their need for positive self-esteem as well as to secure their sense of belonging in organizations. Furthermore, reputation allows individuals to obtain rewards such as autonomy, power, and career success and the opportunity to signal key information to audiences. Likewise, organizations utilize personal reputations to predict their members’ behaviors, market those who are a part of the organization to others, build their own corporate reputations, and signal information to consumers and competitors. To further this understanding of personal reputation an examination is presented as to how organizations serve as an essential context within which individuals realize their personal reputations and regulate their behavior.","2015","2021-05-16 08:24:09","2021-05-16 12:02:07","2021-05-16 08:24:09","451092 Bytes","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Artwork Size: 451092 Bytes Publisher: figshare","<p>My Notes</p> <p>Reputation is only valid within certain contexts</p> <p>Pfeffer, 1992 - reputation gives power and begets even more power</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\85VE32YE\Zinko and Rubin - 2015 - A conceptualization of personal reputation in orga.pdf","","reputation","Applied Psychology; Organizational Behavioral Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It presents a contemporary model of strategic reputation management, helping organizations and stakeholders to analyze the business environment as a communicative field of symbols and meanings in which the organization is built or destroyed.

They illustrate their arguments using real-world examples and studies, from the Finnish Ski Association to Philip Morris International.This book serves as required reading in advanced courses covering public relations practice, advanced topics in PR, corporate communication, management, and marketing.

Yet, they also contain many firms that have survived over generations. How are firms in weak institutional environments able to persist over time? Motivated by 69 interviews with leaders of emerging market firms with histories spanning generations, we combine induction and deduction to propose reputation as a meta-resource that allows firms to activate their conventional resources. We conceptualize reputation as consisting of prominence, perceived quality, and resilience, and develop a process model that illustrates the mechanisms that allow reputation to facilitate survival in ways that persist over time. Building on research in strategy and business history, we thus shed light on an underappreciated strategic construct (reputation) in an undertheorized setting (emerging markets) over an unusual period (the historical long run). Managerial summary: Why are some firms able to persistently survive in challenging, uncertain, and underdeveloped business environments? To explore this question, we analyze in-depth interviews with leaders of emerging market firms that have survived over decades and even centuries. We find that firm reputation is a key strategic driver, and propose new ideas about the ways through which reputation facilitates survival. We elaborate how a favorable reputation allows a firm to more fully utilize its existing resources by decreasing uncertainty. We also propose that reputation has offensive and defensive properties that make it valuable to firms during both positive and negative economic cycles. Finally, we discuss why a reputation-based source of competitive advantage is hard to imitate, and outline three general approaches for building reputation.

What best explains whether a ﬁrm relies on market control or hierarchical control to secure required resources? How do the characteristics of the resources come into play? In this study, we consider a comprehensive path model of the governance mode decision for sourcing technological know-how. By integrating different perspectives on ﬁrm boundaries, including transaction cost economics, a resourcebased view, and an options perspective, we link characteristics of the technology (i.e., uniqueness, barriers to imitation, commercial uncertainty, technological dynamism) to the perceived threat of opportunism, the potential for sustainable advantage, and the pursuit of a licensing agreement vis-a`-vis the outright acquisition of the ﬁrm that possesses the desired know-how. We use structural equation modeling to analyze 127 sourcing arrangements. Our results show that technological dynamism and barriers to imitation indirectly inﬂuence the governance mode decision by increasing the perceived threat of opportunism. Commercial uncertainty directly inﬂuences the governance mode and decreases the likelihood of an acquisition vis-a`-vis a licensing agreement. Although uniqueness and barriers to imitation are also positively associated with the perceived potential for sustainable advantage, the potential for sustainable advantage had no direct effect on governance mode. Implications and suggestions for further research are offered.","2002-08","2021-05-20 10:03:35","2021-06-29 08:35:35","2021-05-20 10:03:35","387-401","","4","13","","Organization Science","Disentangling the Theories of Firm Boundaries","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 8.

The sample is derived from a panel dataset of eighty-six Taiwan high-tech firms, covering six high-tech industry sub-sectors for the period 2004–2012.

For each perspective, we identify core contributions as well as additional questions that extend the current body of research.

Yet, the factors that shape the likelihood of disintermediation have not been extensively explored. In this article, we build from the premise that an alter’s knowledge about the structural hole is a necessary condition for disintermediation. Without this knowledge, the alter will not know with whom to disintermediate. Drawing on research about cognitive social structures, we argue that individuals are most likely to be in a structural hole under the condition of knowledge asymmetry—that is, when brokers know about the structural hole, but alters do not—which reduces the likelihood of disintermediation by alters and increases the benefits for brokers. Using advice network data from a high-tech organization, we find evidence of knowledge asymmetry in existing structural holes, and moderation of this relationship by two factors also related to disintermediation: (1) broker’s reputation and (2) alter’s position as a provider (vs. acquirer) of resources. We also show that knowledge asymmetry is related to higher returns for brokers. The broader theoretical contribution is a better understanding of how network perceptions are related to positions across structural holes, an important structure from which power is derived in organizations and markets.","2016-05-01","2021-05-21 17:15:12","2021-05-30 19:58:54","2021-05-21 17:15:12","118-143","","2","14","","Strategic Organization","Knowledge asymmetry and brokerage","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","D:\GDriveEssec\Zotero\Hahl et al_2016_Knowledge asymmetry and brokerage.pdf","","брокерство","social networks; cognitive social structures; design and boundaries; network forms; network structure; network theory; organizational structure; structural holes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archived data gathered during an ethnography of IDEO, a product design firm. This firm exploits its network position, working for clients in at least 40 industries, to gain knowledge of existing technological solutions in various industries. It acts as a technology broker by introducing these solutions where they are not known and, in the process, creates new products that are original combinations of existing knowledge from disparate industries. Designers exploit their access to a broad range of technological solutions with organizational routines for acquiring and storing this knowledge in the organization's memory and, by making analogies between current design problems and the past solutions they have seen, retrieving that knowledge to generate new solutions to design problems in other industries. We discuss the implications of this research for understanding the individual and organizational processes and norms underlying technology and knowledge transfer more generally.","1997","2021-05-22 18:18:15","2021-05-30 19:58:54","2021-05-22 18:18:15","716-749","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Sage Publications, Inc., Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University]","","","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I propose that brokers prefer to represent high-quality actors and that the value an actor places on representation is inversely related to the actor's perceived quality. But matching of more reputable brokers with higher-quality actors should mitigate these quality constraints. Empirical analyses of 1,028 venture capital funds raised by 745 firms from 2001 to 2006 support the theory. The likelihood that a firm's venture fund is represented by a placement agent first increases and then decreases with firm quality, measured as size, experience, and status. Neither those that value representation most (i.e., funds of low perceived quality) nor those that placement agents would most like to represent (i.e., funds of high perceived quality) are most likely to be represented by a placement agent. Results also show that more reputable placement agents represent funds raised by higher-quality firms, which indicates that a broker's reputation mitigates constraints on the control benefits of brokerage.","2009-12-01","2021-05-22 18:42:52","2021-05-30 19:58:54","2021-05-22 18:42:52","575-601","","4","54","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Constraints on the Control Benefits of Brokerage","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\GDriveEssec\Zotero\Rider_2009_Constraints on the Control Benefits of Brokerage.pdf","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasingly, firms also partner across institutional boundaries (countries, industries, technologies) in their search for new knowledge. When both structural and institutional separation affect knowledge recombination, aggregate characterizations of ego network attributes mask distinct recombination processes that lead to distinct types of innovation outcomes. We address this issue by focusing on triads as the locus of recombination in networks. We partition firms’ networks into three configurations of open triads—foreign, domestic, and mixed—based on the distribution of the broker and its partners across or within institutional boundaries. We argue that each configuration embodies distinct recombination processes, with foreign triads offering high access to novel knowledge, domestic triads facilitating relatively efficient knowledge integration, and mixed triads balancing the two. We apply this approach to a global research and development alliance network in the biotechnology industry, using countries as institutional boundaries. The results show that domestic triads affect innovation volume (i.e., the productivity of innovation) more strongly than mixed or foreign triads. In contrast, foreign triads have a greater impact on innovation radicalness (i.e., the path-breaking nature of the innovation) than mixed or domestic triads. The findings suggest that different brokerage configurations embody unique recombination processes, leading to distinct innovation outcomes. Our research provides a deeper understanding of how networks and institutions jointly influence distinct aspects of innovation.The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2017.1165.","2018-01-30","2021-05-23 08:11:06","2021-05-30 19:58:54","2021-05-23 08:11:06","80-99","","1","29","","Organization Science","Networks and Innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","D:\GDriveEssec\Zotero\Balachandran_Hernandez_2018_Networks and Innovation.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZZJHUVJ8\orsc.2017.html","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrating arguments about network structure and the similarity of actors’ knowledge, we propose two types of network configurations that combine diversity and ease of interpretation. Closed-diverse networks offer diversity in actors’ knowledge domains and shared third-party ties to help in interpreting that knowledge. In open-specialized networks, structural holes offer diversity, while shared interpretive schema and overlap between received information and actors’ prior knowledge help in interpreting new information without the help of third parties. In contrast, actors in open-diverse networks suffer from information overload due to the lack of shared schema or overlapping prior knowledge for the interpretation of diverse information, and actors in closed-specialized networks suffer from overembeddedness because they cannot access diverse information. Using CrunchBase data on early-stage venture capital investments in the U.S. information technology sector, we test the effect of investors’ social capital on the success of their portfolio ventures. We find that ventures have the highest chances of success if their syndicating investors have either open-specialized or closed-diverse networks. These effects are manifested beyond the direct effects of ventures’ or investors’ quality and are robust to controlling for the possibility that certain investors could have chosen more promising ventures at the time of first funding.","2016-09-01","2021-05-23 08:14:00","2021-06-24 13:41:46","2021-05-23 08:14:00","393-432","","3","61","","Administrative Science Quarterly","The Best of Both Worlds","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\GDriveEssec\Zotero\Ter Wal et al_2016_The Best of Both Worlds.pdf","","менторство; брокерство","social capital; structural holes; actors’ knowledge similarity; brokerage; closure; information redundancy; network; network diversity; startups; venture capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper integrates economic and cognitive perspectives, and shows how firms and constituents jointly construct the environments in which firms compete. We argue that competitive advantage is a systemic outcome that develops as firms and constituents participate in six processes that entail, not only use and exchange of resources, but also communication about and interpretations of those exchanges. The interpretations that firms and constituents make of competitive interactions affect decisions about how to exchange and use resources. As interpretations and evaluations of a given firm fluctuate, so do the resources the firm has access to and its competitive advantage in the marketplace. The actions and interpretations of constituents and rivals produce the shifting terrain on which competition unfolds. We illustrate these dynamics with a discussion of IBM’s changing competitive advantage in the computer industry in the 1980s.

Design/methodology/approach – Existing mentoring and e‐mentoring models are evaluated as the context for the development of an innovative e‐mentoring programme for professional women in the UK (Empathy‐Edge). The European Union‐funded programme consisted of 122 participants who were matched by a combination of psychological profiling and analytical processing of these data to produce optimal matches. The e‐mentoring system employed a comprehensive range of resources and communication media which are often not included in similar systems. Findings – Initial evaluation data are presented. The benefits and challenges of e‐mentoring are analysed, together with initial recommendations for implementing effective schemes. Practical implications – The paper argues that e‐mentoring is a valuable tool for the career and management development of both returners and employed women who wish to break through the “glass ceiling”. It also indirectly improves their information and communications technologies (ICT) skills. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the strategic importance of psychological profiling for matching mentoring participants. Originality/value – The field of e‐mentoring is relatively new and is under‐researched, particularly from a European perspective.

In addition, there is an emphasis on the leadership development of the mentors. Reverse mentoring is situated in the mentoring literature as an alternative form of mentoring, with unique characteristics and support functions exchanged that distinguish it from other developmental relationships. A model is developed that focuses on key variables to consider and how reverse mentoring may benefit individuals and organizations.

This analysis will necessarily require a reexamination of traditional models of career stages, particularly in relation to issues of aging in the career context. The paper starts with an examination of the “career contract,” the set of mutual expectations between employer and employee and on the ways that contract has changed over the last decade. Our summary view of the new contract is that it reflects a move from an organizationally based career to a protean or self-based career. This change has particularly strong implications, positive and negative, for older workers, and these are explored in depth. We argue that the contemporary high-speed work environment demands two key competencies (which we call “meta-skills,” since they are skills for learning how to learn): identity development and heightened adaptability. The development of these meta-skills occurs through a process of midca- reer “routine-busting.” In our view, this suggests a new view of career stages, in which the focus is on many cycles of learning stages (continuous learning), rather than a single lifelong career stage cycle. The paper concludes with the implication of these new career concepts for the development of older workers, questioning the currently popular model of retraining and calling instead forcontinuous learningas a means of providing lifelong development for workers of all ages.","1995-12-01","2021-05-28 10:35:07","2021-05-30 19:56:15","2021-05-28 10:35:07","269-289","","3","47","","Journal of Vocational Behavior","The New Career Contract","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PKHIR2LX\Hall and Mirvis - 1995 - The New Career Contract Developing the Whole Pers.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PQ5CQVTQ\S0001879185700048.html","","менторство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a sample of 138 interns on six-month overseas assignments, the results indicate that interns who are different in nationality and gender from their mentors are much less likely to receive task-related, social-related, and career-related support from them. Moreover, this deficit in mentoring is associated with poorer socialization to internship assignments, lower levels of learning about international business, lower likelihoods of receiving and accepting job offers from internship employers, and lower perceived career instrumentality of the internships. The implications of the results for future research on mentor–protege diversity and the design of international internships are discussed as well.

A Mount Hermon and Harvard education, cut off short of the bachelor’s degree, was followed by nearly forty years in the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. His career began in the Statistical Department, took him to technical expertness in the economics of rates and administrative experience in the management of commercial operations, and culminated in the presidency of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. He was not directly involved in the Western Electric experiments conducted chiefly at the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, but his association with Elton Mayo and the latter’s colleagues at the Harvard Business School had an important bearing on his most original ideas.Barnard’s executive experience at AT&T was paralleled and followed by a career in public service unusual in his own time and hardly routine today. He was at various times president of the United Services Organization (the USO of World War II), head of the General Education Board and later president of the Rockefeller Foundation (after Raymond Fosdick and before Dean Rusk), chairman of the National Science Foundation, an assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, a consultant to the American representative in the United Nations Atomic Energy Committee, to name only some of his public interests. He was a director of a number of companies, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a lover of music and a founder of the Bach Society of New Jersey.","1971-01-01","2021-06-06 09:38:58","2021-06-06 09:38:58","","","334","","","","","The Functions of the Executive","","","","","Harvard University Press","Cambridge, Mass.","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Functions-Executive-30th-Anniversary/dp/0674328035","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30th ed. edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LCW3CUZ2","journalArticle","","Campa, Jose Manuel; Kedia, Simi","Explaining the Diversification Discount","The Journal of Finance","","","","","This paper argues that the documented discount on diversified firms is not per se evidence that diversification destroys value. Firms choose to diversify. We use three alternative econometric techniques to control for the endogeneity of the diversification decision, and find evidence supporting the self-selection of diversifying firms. We find a strong negative correlation between a firm’s choice to diversify and firm value. The diversification discount always drops, and sometimes turns into a premium. There also exists evidence of self-selection by refocusing firms. These results point to the importance of explicitly modeling the endogeneity of the diversification status in analyzing its effect on firm value.","","2021-06-10 15:33:24","2021-06-29 09:00:39","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","3023311111","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 9.

We advance the existing conceptualization of synergies in three ways. First, we develop a theoretically-motivated, parsimonious typology of five distinct sources of synergy based on two underlying dimensions: the level of analysis at which valuable activities occur and the orientation by which those activities are governed. The typology uncovers three novel synergy sources (relational, network, and non-market) arising from acquisition-induced changes in firms’ external cooperative environments, and classifies two other well-known synergies (internal and market power). Second, we introduce the concept of synergy lifecycles to explore how the timing of initial realization and the duration of gains vary across the five synergies, based on differences in the post-merger integration required and in the control the acquirer has over the assets and activities combined by the merger. Third, we consider how the synergy types interact, yielding co-synergies when they complement each other and dissynergies when they substitute for one other. This enables us to expand the traditional conceptualization of the total value created by M&A as the sum of each of the synergy types, their co-synergies, and their dis-synergies.","2021-03-04","2021-06-10 15:37:59","2021-06-29 09:04:56","2021-06-10 15:37:59","amr.2018.0345","","","","","AMR","Synergy in Mergers and Acquisitions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","3133939604","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Corporate and Business Strategy\Session 10.

However, it argues that this turn is incomplete in that researchers currently concentrate either on strategy activity at the intra-organizational level or on the aggregate effects of this activity at the extra-organizational level. The paper proposes a framework for strategy research that integrates these two levels based on the three concepts of strategy praxis, strategy practices and strategy practitioners. The paper develops implications of this framework for research, particularly with regard to the impact of strategy practices on strategy praxis, the creation and transfer of strategy practices and the making of strategy practitioners. The paper concludes by outlining the distinctive emphases of the practice perspective within the strategy discipline.","2006-05","2021-06-15 09:06:17","2021-06-15 09:09:08","2021-06-15 09:06:17","613-634","","5","27","","Organization Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM1\Session5.

Using a workplace studies approach, we analyse the work of museum tour guides as a salient example of workers engaged in frontline work. Our findings demonstrate the subtle and intricate nature of the embodied work of frontline workers as they ‘bring into being’ the strategic aims of an organization. We identified five elements as central to this process: (1) the situated physical context; (2) audience composition; (3) the moral order; (4) the talk, actions and gestures of the guide; and (5) the corresponding talk, actions and gestures of the audience. Drawing on these categories, we find frontline workers to demonstrate ‘interactional competence’: assessing and making use of the physical, spatial and material specifics of the context and those they are interacting with, and enlisting interactional resources to uphold a moral order that brings these others in as a working audience, encouraging them to respond in particular ways. Frontline workers thus skilfully combine language, material and bodily expressions in the flow of their work. Demonstrating these dynamics gives a more central role to material in the realization of strategy than previously recognized; demonstrates that ‘outsiders’ have an important part to play in realizing strategy; and highlights the importance of frontline workers and their skilled work in bringing strategy into being.","2015-10","2021-06-15 09:06:19","2021-06-15 09:09:08","2021-06-15 09:06:19","1285-1313","","10","36","","Organization Studies","Selling the Object of Strategy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM1\Session5.

Relationalism rejects essentialism and a priori categories and insist upon the intersubjectivity of experience and meaning as well as the importance of content of interactions and their historical setting. Formalism is based on a structura interpretation of the theoretical works of Georg Simmel. Simmel laid out a neo-Kant program of identifying a priori categories of relational types and patterns that oper independently of cultural content or historical setting. Formalism and relationalism internally consistent theoretical perspectives, but there are tensions between them. pave the way for stronger middle-range theoretical development, I disaggregate the t approaches and highlight the contradictions that must be addressed or resolved for t construction of any general and inclusive theory.","2013-09","2021-06-15 09:31:56","2021-06-15 09:39:31","2021-06-15 09:31:56","219-242","","3","31","","Sociological Theory","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 3.

This paper concerns the extent to which economic action is embedded in structures of social relations, in modern industrial society. Although the usual neoclasical accounts provide an ""undersocialized"" or atomized-actor explanation of such action, reformist economists who attempt to bring social structure back in do so in the ""oversocialized"" way criticized by Dennis Wrong. Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures.

By reconceptualizing organizational identity as not just a signal of organizational legitimacy but also a lens used by evaluating audiences to make sense of emerging information, I explore the micro, decision-making foundations on which both conformist and nonconformist organizations may come to be favored. Analyzing the association between organizational conformity and return on investment and capital flows in the global hedge fund industry, 1994-2008, I find that investors allocate capital more readily to nonconforming hedge funds following periods of short-term positive performance. Contrary to prediction, nonconforming funds are also less severely penalized for recent poor performance. Both “amplification” and “buffering” effects persist for funds with nonconformist identities despite steady-state normative pressure toward conformity. I explore the asymmetry of this outcome, and what it means for theories related to organizational identity and legitimacy, in the discussion section.","2011-03","2021-06-15 09:41:02","2021-06-15 09:42:41","2021-06-15 09:41:02","61-94","","1","56","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Identities as Lenses","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 4.

Here, I suggest this depends on the audience evaluating the organization. Audiences that are ""market-takers"" consume or evaluate goods and use market labels to find and assess organizations; for them, ambiguous labels make organizations unclear and therefore less appealing. ""Market-makers"" are interested in redefining the market structure, and as a result, this type of audience sees the same ambiguity as flexible and therefore more appealing. I tested these ideas in a longitudinal analysis of U.S. software organizations between 1990 and 2002. As predicted, organizations that claim ambiguous labels are less appealing to consumers, an audience of market-takers, but more appealing to venture capitalists, who are market-makers. Further, when labels are ambiguous, aversion to or preference for ambiguity arises from the label itself. Identifying with multiple ambiguous labels does not make an organization even less appealing to a consumer or more appealing to a venture capitalist. Finally, all types of venture capitalists are not alike in how they react to a label's ambiguity. Independent venture capitalists act as market-makers and prefer organizations with ambiguous labels, while corporate venture capitalists act as market-takers and avoid them.","2012-03","2021-06-15 09:41:04","2021-06-15 09:42:41","2021-06-15 09:41:04","81-118","","1","57","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Two Sides of the Same Coin","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 4.

Building on recent work elaborating the need to reward the greater risk associated with atypicality for it to survive, this article provides the first systematic, direct evidence for such a reward. We focus on stylistic inconsistency - mixing distinct artistic styles. In a between-subject experimental design, 183 subjects estimated the aesthetic and market value of consistent and inconsistent sets of artworks by Pablo Picasso in three status conditions. Controlling for cognitive difficulties posed by inconsistency, we show that inconsistency is rewarded (i.e., evaluated higher than consistency on aesthetic value) only at high status. Status cues guide perception so that inconsistent works by a prominent artist are given the benefit of the doubt and interpreted as a sign of creativity. The association with creativity leads to a reward for atypicality in the absence of tangible proof that it performs better than typicality.","2014-04","2021-06-15 09:41:06","2021-06-15 09:42:41","2021-06-15 09:41:06","282-302","","2","79","","Am Sociol Rev","“Notable” or “Not Able”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 4.

We find that in the absence of organizational or professional membership, workers experience stark emotional tensions encompassing both the anxiety and fulfillment of working in precarious and personal conditions. Lacking the holding environment provided by an organization, the workers we studied endeavored to create one for themselves through cultivating connections to routines, places, people, and a broader purpose. These personal holding environments helped them manage the broad range of emotions stirred up by their precarious working lives and focus on producing work that let them define, express, and develop their selves. Thus holding environments transformed workers’ precariousness into a tolerable and even generative predicament. By clarifying the process through which people manage emotions associated with precarious and personalized work identities, and thereby render their work identities viable and their selves vital, this paper advances theorizing on the emotional underpinnings of identity work and the systems psychodynamics of independent work.","2019-03","2021-06-15 10:03:14","2021-06-15 10:12:34","2021-06-15 10:03:14","124-170","","1","64","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Agony and Ecstasy in the Gig Economy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 7.

Current discussion of the implication of AI and the future of work gloss four important issues: variation, power, ideology, and institutions. By a unified approach we mean a research agenda that coordinates studies of variation in use with research on power, ideology, design, and institutional change, all focused on a specific technology or set of technologies. The approach rests on the image of a technology timeline that begins with the issues of power and ideology that underwrite the promotion of intelligent technologies by firms and other stakeholders that have an interest in building and diffusing such technologies. Moving to the right the timeline encompasses studies of design, implementation, and use that pay attention to variation in how intelligent technologies occasion changes in work and employment. Finally, the unified approach extends beyond current workplace studies to consider the institutional changes that may arise as the result of how intelligent technologies are used and employs such considerations to shape the agenda of promoters and designers so that they will create technologies that better benefit society.","2020-06","2021-06-15 10:03:18","2021-06-15 10:12:34","2021-06-15 10:03:18","100286","","2","30","","Information and Organization","Beyond design and use","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\FoM1_2\FOM2\Session 7.

"737VPRW8","book","1937","Coase, Ronald Harry","The Nature of the Firm: Origins, Evolution, and Development","","978-0-19-508356-9","","","","In 1937, Ronald H. Coase published The Nature of the Firm, a classic paper that raised fundamental questions about the concept of the firm in economic theory. Coase proposed that the comparative costs of organizing transactions through markets rather than within firms are the primary determinants of the size and scope of firms. Coase won the 1991 Nobel Prize in Economics for this work. This volume derives from a conference held in 1987 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Coase's classic article. The first chapter affords an overview of the volume. It is followed by a republication of the 1937 article, and by the three lectures Coase presented at the conference. These lectures provide a lively and informative history of the origins and development of his thought. Subsequent chapters explore a wide-range of theoretical and empirical issues that have arisen in the transaction cost economic tradition. They illustrate the power of the transaction cost approach to enhance understanding not only of business firms, but of problems of economic organization generally. In addition to Coase's work, contributors include Sherwin Rosen, Paul Joskow, Oliver Hart, Harold Demsetz, Scott Masten, Benjamin Klein, as well as the volume's editors, Oliver E. Williamson, and Sidney G. Winter. The Nature of the Firm includes Coase's acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize in Economics.","1937","2021-06-16 06:44:15","2021-06-16 08:52:36","","","260","","","","","The Nature of the Firm","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VXIDgGjLHVgC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=VXIDgGjLHVgC","","Bibles / New American Bible / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These four views represent qualitatively different concepts of organizational structure, behavior, change, and managerial roles. Six theoretical debates are then identified by systematically juxtaposing the four views against each other, and a partial reconciliation is achieved by bringing opposing viewpoints into dialectical relief. The six debates, which tend to be addressed singly and in isolation from each other in the literature, are then integrated at a metatheoretical level. The framework presented thus attempts to overcome the problems associated with excessive theoretical compartmentalization by focusing on the interplay between divergent theoretical perspectives, but it also attempts to preserve the authenticity of distinctive viewpoints, thereby retaining the advantages associated with theoretical pluralism.","1983","2021-06-16 06:50:45","2021-06-16 06:50:45","2021-06-16 06:50:45","245-273","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Sage Publications, Inc., Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University]","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HMV6MXE9\Key debates in OT.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it still remains somewhat vague as to what exactly BC are, how they can or even should be explored, and why their understanding matters. This research tackles these important questions by means of an in-depth theoretical-methodological analysis. The study contributes fourfold to organizational research methods: First, it develops a more accurate and explicit conceptualization of BC. Second, it widens the understanding of how BC can be explored by suggesting and juxtaposing new tools and approaches. It also illustrates BC-exploring processes, drawing on two empirical case examples. Third, it analyzes the reasons for exploring BC, concluding that BC exploration fosters theory development, strengthens research validity, and mitigates the research-practice gap. Fourth, it synthesizes the analyses into 12 tentative suggestions for how scholars should subsequently approach the issues surrounding BC. The authors hope that the study contributes to consensus shifting with respect to BC and draws more attention to BC.","2017-10-01","2021-06-17 06:28:30","2021-06-17 06:28:30","2021-06-17 06:28:30","574-609","","4","20","","Organizational Research Methods","Boundary Conditions","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZC5TLWKY\Busse et al. - 2017 - Boundary Conditions What They Are, How to Explore.pdf","","","boundary condition; context; generalizability; research-practice gap; theorizing; validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronic mentoring has been developed based on the possibilities unique to information and communications technology. The common feature of electronic mentoring programmes is the independence from geography and time constraints for connecting mentoring participants. The article provides a brief introduction to the concept of mentoring and its benefits, especially for students in engineering. It continues with exploring the differences of electronic and face-to-face mentoring and discusses the advantages and challenges of electronic mentoring programmes. The reader's understanding of how an actual electronic mentoring programme works is enhanced by introducing MentorNet (www.MentorNet.net), the e-mentoring network for women in engineering and related sciences. Although this programme is specifically designed to support women students in engineering and sciences, many aspects are applicable to electronic mentoring programmes with a different target population. The article concludes by suggesting that good mentoring experiences—whether face-to-face or e-mentoring—can help create a positive attitude towards lifelong learning opportunities that are beneficial to all students.","2004-03-01","2021-06-19 11:21:55","2021-06-24 13:41:56","2021-06-19 11:21:55","53-63","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0304379032000129304","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SHS3ATS5\Mueller_2004_Electronic mentoring as an example for the use of information and.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UNSP2IQQ\0304379032000129304.html","","менторство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Past research has found that within the three functions of mentoring (psychosocial, vocational, and role modeling), a mentor can play a number of roles such as business coach, friend, counselor, and/or teacher to a protégé.

On the collaboration network of U. S. biotech inventors during 1976-1995, I find that inventors with superior track records are more apt to form collaboration ties that enhance brokerage, thereby occupying positions that allow them to broker across network boundaries. Controlling for past performance significantly weakens the positive relationship between brokering position and innovative performance. Furthermore, when inventor-level heterogeneity is controlled for through inventor fixed effects, the position-performance correlation disappears. These findings suggest that, at least for collaborative inventors, actor-level heterogeneity such as performance history largely drives the asymmetry in brokerage, explaining most of the position-performance association.","2010","2021-06-21 08:46:52","2021-06-24 13:43:06","2021-06-21 08:46:52","804-822","","4","21","","","Heterogeneity, Brokerage, and Innovative Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early methods developed to identify these social effects assumed that networks had formed exogenously, and were perfectly observed, both of which are unlikely to hold in practice. A more recent literature, both within economics and in other disciplines, develops methods that relax these assumptions. This paper reviews that literature. It starts by providing a general econometric framework for linear models of social effects, and illustrates how network endogeneity and missing data on the network complicate identification of social effects. Thereafter, it discusses methods for overcoming the problems caused by endogenous formation of networks. Finally, it outlines the stark consequences of missing data on measures of the network, and regression parameters, before describing potential solutions.","2018","2021-06-21 08:47:47","2021-06-24 13:43:06","2021-06-21 08:47:47","1016-1044","","4","32","","","Credibly Identifying Social Effects","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Authors.

However, despite its relevance, the ﬁeld of psychology has been relatively slow to explain the underlying goal pursuit and resistance processes inﬂuencing social networks in the ﬁrst place. In this vein, this article aims to demonstrate how a dynamic network theory perspective explains the way in which social networks inﬂuence these processes and related outcomes, such as goal achievement, performance, learning, and emotional contagion at the interpersonal level of analysis. The theory integrates goal pursuit, motivation, and conﬂict conceptualizations from psychology with social network concepts from sociology and organizational science to provide a taxonomy of social network role behaviors, such as goal striving, system supporting, goal preventing, system negating, and observing. This theoretical perspective provides psychologists with new tools to map social networks (e.g., dynamic network charts), which can help inform the development of change interventions. Implications for social, industrial-organizational, and counseling psychology as well as conﬂict resolution are discussed, and new opportunities for research are highlighted, such as those related to dynamic network intelligence (also known as cognitive accuracy), levels of analysis, methodological/ethical issues, and the need to theoretically broaden the study of social networking and social media behavior.","2014","2021-06-21 10:07:56","2021-06-21 10:07:56","2021-06-21 10:07:56","269-284","","3","69","","American Psychologist","Psychology and social networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Dropbox\Management, ESSEC\Courses\Organizational Behavior\Session 8.

Using a biform game, we examine whether such a position can confer a competitive advantage, as well as whether any such advantage could persist if actors formed relations strategically. Our analysis reveals that, if one considers exogenous the relations between actors, brokers can enjoy an advantage but only if (1) they do not face substitutes either for the connections they offer or the value they can create, (2) they intermediate more than two parties, and (3) interdependence does not lock them into a particular pattern of exchange. If, on the other hand, one allows actors to form relations on the basis of their expectations of the future value of those relations, then profitable positions of intermediation only arise under strict assumptions of unilateral action.

Matching, defined as the process by which individuals are dynamically aligned with organizations and the situations (roles, jobs, tasks, etc.) within them, has historically been examined in silos across a broad range of literatures. Consequently, we know little about how seemingly diverse HR activities, such as recruitment, job design, training, promotions, and terminations, might inform each other through the common lens of matching. Emanating from our review, we integrate relevant literatures to develop a comprehensive matching model (termed the “dynamic matching lifecycle model”). Our model extends prior, more static conceptualizations of matching (like attraction, selection, attrition, or ASA) to include four stages: creation, development, reconfiguration, and termination—based on two broad mechanisms—selection and adaptation. Furthermore, we describe how matching contributes to individual and organizational value creation. By evoking human capital theories, we explain how people and organizations engage in matching across the four stages of the model to create human capital-based value. Our model shows that information and information distribution, organization design, and complementarities play important roles in ensuring successful matching. Promising future research directions are discussed.","2019-01-01","2021-06-25 09:40:38","2021-06-26 12:26:39","2021-06-25 09:40:38","188-214","","1","13","","ANNALS","How Matching Creates Value","","","","","","","","","","","","journals-aom-org.ezp.essec.fr (Atypon)","","Publisher: Academy of Management","<p>we view matching as a complex and delicate<br />challenge.

New forms of work<br />may seriously challenge matching assumptions.<br />At the extreme “uberization” of work (Fleming,<br />2017), spot contracts between firms and independent<br />contractors replace employment relationships.<br />As responsibilities and roles change in the new work<br />economy, platforms such as Upwork and Amazon’s<br />Mechanical Turk can digitalize search and selection,<br />with the automatic support of deep learning algorithms.<br />In the “gig economy” (Brawley, 2017; Kuhn,<br />2016), firms do not train and retain employees, and<br />internal labor markets are virtually nonexistent.<br />Rather, firms delegate much of their employer responsibilities<br />to individuals acting as independent<br />contractors who plan and shape their careers independently<br />and autonomously. For instance, some<br />individuals have boundaryless careers in which they<br />frequently and actively change jobs (DeFillippi &amp;<br />Arthur, 1994; Sullivan, 1999; Sullivan &amp; Arthur,<br />2006), or they may work for firms that provide<br />early career training and then move to firms that<br />compensate for those skills (Bidwell &amp; Briscoe,<br />2010).</p>","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JISTI8WC\annals.2016.html; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Q8ED2X9Y\Weller et al_2019_How Matching Creates Value.pdf","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transferring Constraint through Price Setting in the Staffing Sector","American Sociological Review","","0003-1224","10.1177/000312240707200208","https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240707200208","This article analyzes how a broker's ability to affect prices and extract superior value from its position has economic consequences for the actors tied to it. I argue that intermediaries may exercise partial control in price setting by transferring the price constraints imposed on them by the actors on one side of the market to those on the other side. In so doing, they generate unequal returns for the brokered parties, who then receive different prices due to the nature of the tie between the broker and its other exchange partners. I investigate this argument using a novel mix of quantitative and qualitative data gathered from an intermediary in the staffing sector. The results show that the broker is able to transfer discounts offered to valued buyers (clients) on to the sellers (workers) matched with them, instead of reducing its own margins. As a result, actors with the same resource endowments receive different prices depending on the relationships among other exchange partners in a given triadic network of ties. Using qualitative fieldwork, I elaborate on the mechanisms that make the quantitative results feasible, and I discuss the implications for our understanding of the processes, dynamics, and market stratification consequences of brokerage.","2007-04-01","2021-06-25 10:07:43","2021-06-25 10:18:35","2021-06-25 10:07:43","291-317","","2","72","","Am Sociol Rev","Who Pays the Price of Brokerage?","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AW9LTU79\Fernandez-Mateo_2007_Who Pays the Price of Brokerage.pdf","","брокерство","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines how participation in industry events (e.g. conferences) relates to entrepreneurs' brokerage positions in informal industry networks and how these positions, in turn, impact new venture performance. Using a unique dataset of 45 events and subsequent network relations among entrepreneurs from 90 firms in the open source software industry, results indicate that: (1) entrepreneurs who participated in heterogeneous events or who bridged between events with few common participants were more likely to be brokers; (2) the relationship between event bridging and brokerage was stronger for entrepreneurs with broader prior career experiences; and (3) network brokerage mediated the event participation–performance link. It appears that events may limit structural opportunities for brokerage and that individual differences matter for exploiting these opportunities. Overall, this study increases understanding of how and when particular networking behaviours are beneficial for entrepreneurs.","2010","2021-06-26 09:34:23","2021-06-26 09:34:23","2021-06-26 09:34:23","625-653","","4","47","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Author.

Yet self-monitoring and its measure, the Self-Monitoring Scale, are surrounded by controversy generated by conflicting answers to the critical question, Is self-monitoring a unitary phenomenon? A primary source of answers to this question has been largely neglected—the Self-Monitoring Scale's relations with external criteria. The authors propose a quantitative method to examine the self-monitoring literature and thereby address major issues of the controversy. Application of this method reveals that, with important exceptions, a wide range of external criteria tap a dimension directly measured by the Self-Monitoring Scale. The authors discuss what this appraisal reveals about what self-monitoring is and is not.

This tertius iungens (or “third who joins”) strategic orientation, contrasts with the tertius gaudens orientation emphasized in structural holes theory, which concerns the advantage of a broker who can play people off against one another for his or her own benefit. Results of a multimethod study of networks and innovation in an engineering division of an automotive manufacturer show that a tertius iungens orientation, dense social networks, and diverse social knowledge predict involvement in innovation.
