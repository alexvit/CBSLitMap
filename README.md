# CBSLitMap
**Motivation**  
*I choose this form for the mindmap assignment because I wanted to:*  

1. Automatically obtain readily available information: publication year, citations, authors, journal;  
2. Effortlessly import all information on the papers I've previously added to Zotero (e.g., methodology used, custom topics, notes);  
3. Avoid exposing my awful sense of aesthetics by trying to manually draw and chart things (although the design of the app is also showing, I'm afraid);  
4. Obtain coordinates for the papers based on some objective metric of their relationships and build my mindmaps on that;  
5. Get an insight on what to read next;  
6. Being able to compactly represent all this and conveniently share it;    
7. Have a framework that will do the same thing for other sets of literature at zero additional efforts.
